	"details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: nVMX: Always make an attempt to map eVMCS after migration\n\nWhen enlightened VMCS is in use and nested state is migrated with\nvmx_get_nested_state()/vmx_set_nested_state() KVM can't map evmcs\npage right away: evmcs gpa is not 'struct kvm_vmx_nested_state_hdr'\nand we can't read it from VP assist page because userspace may decide\nto restore HV_X64_MSR_VP_ASSIST_PAGE after restoring nested state\n(and QEMU, for example, does exactly that). To make sure eVMCS is\nmapped /vmx_set_nested_state() raises KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES\nrequest.\n\nCommit f2c7ef3ba955 (\"KVM: nSVM: cancel KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES\non nested vmexit\") added KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES clearing to\nnested_vmx_vmexit() to make sure MSR permission bitmap is not switched\nwhen an immediate exit from L2 to L1 happens right after migration (caused\nby a pending event, for example). Unfortunately, in the exact same\nsituation we still need to have eVMCS mapped so\nnested_sync_vmcs12_to_shadow() reflects changes in VMCS12 to eVMCS.\n\nAs a band-aid, restore nested_get_evmcs_page() when clearing\nKVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES in nested_vmx_vmexit(). The 'fix' is far\nfrom being ideal as we can't easily propagate possible failures and even if\nwe could, this is most likely already too late to do so. The whole\n'KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES' idea for mapping eVMCS after migration\nseems to be fragile as we diverge too much from the 'native' path when\nvmptr loading happens on vmx_set_nested_state().",
