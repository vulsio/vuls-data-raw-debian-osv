	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were found in mediawiki, a website engine for\ncollaborative work, that could lead to information disclosure, privilege\nescalation, or denial of service.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-3550](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3550)\nCarlos Bello reported a stored cross-site scripting (XSS)\n vulnerability when uploading crafted XML file to `Special:Upload`,\n which can lead to privilege escalation. (However `.xml` file uploads\n are not allowed in the default configuration.)\n* [CVE-2023-45362](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-45362)\nTobias Frei discovered that diff-multi-sameuser (âX intermediate\n revisions by the same user not shownâ) ignores username suppression,\n which can lead to information leak.\n* [CVE-2023-45363](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-45363)\nIt was discovered that querying pages redirected to other variants\n with `redirects` and `converttitles` parameters set would cause\n a denial of service (unbounded loop and `RequestTimeoutException`).\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.31.16-1+deb10u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of mediawiki please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/mediawiki>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
