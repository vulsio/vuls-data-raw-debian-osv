	"details": "\nMatteo Memelli discovered a flaw in lldpd, an implementation of the IEEE\n802.1ab protocol. By crafting a CDP PDU packet with specific\nCDP\\_TLV\\_ADDRESSES TLVs, a malicious actor can remotely force the lldpd\ndaemon to perform an out-of-bounds read on heap memory.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.0.3-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lldpd packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of lldpd please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/lldpd>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
