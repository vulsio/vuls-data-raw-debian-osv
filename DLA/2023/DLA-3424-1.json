	"summary": "python-ipaddress - security update",
	"details": "\nMartin Wennberg discovered that python-ipaddress, a Backport of Python 3's\nipaddress module, improperly computed hash values in the\n`IPv4Interface` and `IPv6Interface` classes, which might\nallow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service if an application is\naffected by the performance of a dictionary containing\n`IPv4Interface` or IPv6Interface objects. The\nattacker can use this flaw to cause many dictionary entries to be created.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.0.17-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-ipaddress packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python-ipaddress please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-ipaddress>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
