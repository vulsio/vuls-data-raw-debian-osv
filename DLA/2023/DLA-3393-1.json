	"details": "\nThis update fixes a NULL pointer derference and two denial of service\nconditions in in protobuf.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-22569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22569)\nAn issue in protobuf-java allowed the interleaving of\n `com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet` fields in such a way that would be\n processed out of order. A small malicious payload can occupy the parser for\n several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause\n frequent, repeated pauses.\n* [CVE-2021-22570](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22570)\nNullptr dereference when a null char is present in a proto symbol. The\n symbol is parsed incorrectly, leading to an unchecked call into the proto\n file's name during generation of the resulting error message. Since the\n symbol is incorrectly parsed, the file is nullptr.\n* [CVE-2022-1941](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1941)\nA parsing vulnerability for the `MessageSet` type in the ProtocolBuffers can\n lead to out of memory failures. A specially crafted message with multiple\n key-value per elements creates parsing issues, and can lead to a Denial of\n Service against services receiving unsanitized input.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.6.1.3-2+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your protobuf packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of protobuf please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/protobuf>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
