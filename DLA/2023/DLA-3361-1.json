	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential remote denial of service\nvulnerability in Redis, a popular key-value database.\n\n\nAuthenticated users could have used string matching commands (like\n`SCAN` or `KEYS`) with a specially crafted pattern to\ntrigger a denial-of-service attack, causing it to hang and consume 100% CPU\ntime.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-36021](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-36021)\nRedis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users can use string matching commands (like `SCAN` or `KEYS`) with a specially crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service attack on Redis, causing it to hang and consume 100% CPU time. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.0.18, 6.2.11, 7.0.9.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n5:5.0.14-1+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
