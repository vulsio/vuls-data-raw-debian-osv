	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an issue in the opendmarc DMARC\nemail filter system. A vulnerability allowed attackers to inject authentication\nresults to provide false information about the domain that originated an email\nmessage. This was caused by incorrect parsing and interpretation of SPF/DKIM\nauthentication results.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-12272](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12272)\nOpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x allows attacks that inject\n authentication results to provide false information about the domain that\n originated an e-mail message. This is caused by incorrect parsing and\n interpretation of SPF/DKIM authentication results, as demonstrated by the\n example.net(.example.com substring.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.3.2-6+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your opendmarc packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
