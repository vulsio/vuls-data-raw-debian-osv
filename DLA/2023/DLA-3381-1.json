	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential buffer-overflow\nvulnerability in ghostscript, a popular interpreter for the\nPostScript language used, for example, to generate PDF files.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-28879](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-28879)\nIn Artifex Ghostscript through 10.01.0, there is a buffer overflow\n leading to potential corruption of data internal to the PostScript\n interpreter, in base/sbcp.c. This affects BCPEncode, BCPDecode, TBCPEncode,\n and TBCPDecode. If the write buffer is filled to one byte less than full,\n and one then tries to write an escaped character, two bytes are\n written.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n9.27~dfsg-2+deb10u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
