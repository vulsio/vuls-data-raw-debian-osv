	"details": "\nAn issue was discovered in Nova, an OpenStack project that provides a\nway to provision compute instances (aka virtual servers). By supplying\na specially created VMDK flat image that references a specific backing\nfile path, an authenticated user may convince systems to return a copy\nof that file's contents from the server, resulting in unauthorized\naccess to potentially sensitive data.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n2:18.1.0-6+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nova packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of nova please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/nova>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
