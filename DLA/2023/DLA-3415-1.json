	"summary": "python-django - security update",
	"details": "\nt was discovered that there was a potential validation bypass in\n[Djang](https://djangoproject.com), a popular Python-based web\ndevelopment framework.\n\n\nUploading multiple files using one form field has never been supported by\n`forms.FileField` or `forms.ImageField`, as only the last\nuploaded file was ever validated. Unfortunately, the uploading multiple files\ntopic in the documentation suggested otherwise.\n\n\nIn order to avoid a vulnerability, `ClearableFileInput` and\n`FileInput` form widgets now raise `ValueError` when the\nmultiple HTML attribute is set on them. To prevent the exception and keep the\nold behavior, set `allow_multiple_selected` to\n`True`.\n\n\nFor more details on using the new attribute and handling of multiple\nfiles through a single field, please see\n[upstream's website](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/may/03/security-releases/)\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-31047](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31047)\nPotential bypass of validation when uploading multiple files using one form field\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:1.11.29-1+deb10u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
