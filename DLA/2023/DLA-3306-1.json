	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential Denial of Service (DoS)\nvulnerability in Django, a popular Python-based web development framework.\n\n\nParsed values of the `Accept-Language` HTTP headers are cached by\nDjango order to avoid repetitive parsing. This could have led to a potential\ndenial-of-service attack via excessive memory usage if the raw value of\n`Accept-Language` headers was very large.\n\n\n`Accept-Language` headers are now limited to a maximum length\nspecifically in order to avoid this issue.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-23969](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-23969)\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:1.11.29-1+deb10u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
