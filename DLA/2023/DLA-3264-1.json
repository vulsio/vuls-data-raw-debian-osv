	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential reflected file download (RFD)\nvulnerability in ruby-sinatra, a Ruby library for writing HTTP applications. A\nContent-Disposition HTTP header was being incorrectly derived from a\npotentially user-supplied filename.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-45442](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-45442)\nSinatra is a domain-specific language for creating web applications in\n Ruby. An issue was discovered in Sinatra 2.0 before 2.2.3 and 3.0 before\n 3.0.4. An application is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD)\n attack that sets the Content-Disposition header of a response when the\n filename is derived from user-supplied input. Version 2.2.3 and 3.0.4\n contain patches for this issue.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.0.5-4+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-sinatra packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
