Given an electro-magnetic trace\n of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed.\n* [CVE-2020-12400](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12400)\nWhen converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular\n inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible\n timing-based side channel attack.\n* [CVE-2020-12401](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12401)\nDuring ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to\n ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in\n variable-time execution dependent on secret data.\n* [CVE-2020-12403](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12403)\nA flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS.\n When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads.\n This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20Â \n (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length.\n* [CVE-2023-0767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0767)\nChristian Holler discovered that incorrect handling of PKCS 12 Safe Bag\n attributes may result in execution of arbitrary code if a specially crafted\n PKCS 12 certificate bundle is processed.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2:3.42.1-1+deb10u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of nss please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/nss>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
