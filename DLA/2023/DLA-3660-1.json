	"summary": "gnutls28 - security update",
	"details": "\nA vulnerability was found in GnuTLS, a secure communications library, which\nmay facilitate a timing attack to compromise a cryptographic system. The\nresponse times to malformed ciphertexts in RSA-PSK ClientKeyExchange differ\nfrom response times of ciphertexts with correct PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. Only\nTLS ciphertext processing is affected.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.6.7-4+deb10u11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of gnutls28 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/gnutls28>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
