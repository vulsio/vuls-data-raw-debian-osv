	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential memory corrution vulnerability\nin python-cryptography, a Python library offering a number of encryption and\ncryptography primitives.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-23931](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-23931)\ncryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update\\_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update\\_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.6.1-3+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-cryptography packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
