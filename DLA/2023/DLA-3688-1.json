	"summary": "haproxy - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential information disclosure\nvulnerability in HAProxy, a reverse proxy server used to load balance\nHTTP requests across multiple servers.\n\n\nHAProxy formerly accepted the `#` (ie. the \"pound\" or \"hash\")\nsymbol as part of a URI component. This might have allowed remote attackers to\nobtain sensitive information upon HAProxy's misinterpretation of a\n`path_end` rule, such as by routing `index.html#.png` to\na static server.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-45539](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-45539)\nHAProxy before 2.8.2 accepts # as part of the URI component, which might\n allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or have unspecified\n other impact upon misinterpretation of a path\\_end rule, such as routing\n index.html#.png to a static server.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.8.19-1+deb10u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
