	"details": "\nMultiple security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source\ngeneral purpose scripting language, which could result in denial of\nservice or incorrect validation of BCrypt hashes.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-31631](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-31631)\nDue to an uncaught integer overflow, `PDO::quote()` of\n `PDO_SQLite` may return an improperly quoted string.\n The exact details likely depend on the implementation of\n `sqlite3_snprintf()`, but with some versions it is possible to\n force the function to return a single apostrophe, if the function is\n called on user supplied input without any length restrictions in\n place.\n* [CVE-2023-0567](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0567)\nTim DĂźsterhus discovered that malformed BCrypt hashes that include a\n `$` character within their salt part trigger a buffer\n overread and may erroneously validate any password as valid.\n (`Password_verify()` always returns `true` with such\n inputs.)\n* [CVE-2023-0568](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0568)\n1-byte array overrun when appending slash to paths during path\n resolution.\n* [CVE-2023-0662](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0662)\nJakob Ackermann discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability when\n parsing multipart request body: the request body parsing in PHP\n allows any unauthenticated attacker to consume a large amount of CPU\n time and trigger excessive logging.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.3.31-1~deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php7.3 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of php7.3 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/php7.3>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
