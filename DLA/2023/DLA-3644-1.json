	"details": "\nIt was discovered there was a potential remote code execution vulnerability\nin phppgadmin, a web-based administration tool for the PostgreSQL database\nserver. This issue concerned the deserialisation of untrusted data, which may\nhave led to remote code execution because user-controlled data was being passed\ndirectly to the PHP `unserialize()` function.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-40619](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-40619)\nphpPgAdmin 7.14.4 and earlier is vulnerable to deserialization of\n untrusted data which may lead to remote code execution because\n user-controlled data is directly passed to the PHP 'unserialize()' function\n in multiple places. An example is the functionality to manage tables in\n 'tables.php' where the 'ma[]' POST parameter is deserialized.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n5.1+ds-4+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phppgadmin packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
