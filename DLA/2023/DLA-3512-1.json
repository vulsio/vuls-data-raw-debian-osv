This flaw allows an attacker to leak\n sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads\n and virtualized guests.\n\n\nFor details please refer to\n  and\n .\n\n\nThis issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the\n amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.\n However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides\n updates for second generation EPYC CPUs. Various Ryzen CPUs are\n also affected, but no updates are available yet.\n* [CVE-2023-31248](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31248)\nMingi Cho discovered a use-after-free flaw in the Netfilter\n nf\\_tables implementation when using nft\\_chain\\_lookup\\_byid, which\n may result in local privilege escalation for a user with the\n CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.\n* [CVE-2023-35001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-35001)\nTanguy DUBROCA discovered an out-of-bounds reads and write flaw in\n the Netfilter nf\\_tables implementation when processing an\n nft\\_byteorder expression, which may result in local privilege\n escalation for a user with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability in any\n user or network namespace.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.10.179-3~deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux-5.10 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-5.10>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
