	"details": "\nVulnerabilities were found in libssh2, a client-side C library\nimplementing the SSH2 protocol, which could lead to denial of service or\nremote information disclosure.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-13115](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13115)\nKevin Backhouse discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in\n `kex.c`'s `kex_method_diffie_hellman_group_exchange_sha256_key_exchange()`\n function, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way\n packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises\n an SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause\n a denial of service condition on the client system when a user\n connects to the server.\n* [CVE-2019-17498](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17498)\nKevin Backhouse discovered that the `SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT` logic in\n packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, thereby enabling\n an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a\n subsequent memory read. A malicious SSH server may be able to\n disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service\n condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.\n* [CVE-2020-22218](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-22218)\nAn issue was discovered in `function _libssh2_packet_add()`, which\n could allow attackers to access out of bounds memory.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.8.0-2.1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libssh2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libssh2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libssh2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
