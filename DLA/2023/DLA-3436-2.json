	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were found in sssd, a set of daemons to manage\naccess to remote directories and authentication mechanisms, which could\nlead to privilege escalation.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-16838](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16838)\nIt was discovered that when the Group Policy Objects (GPO) are not\n readable by SSSD due to a too strict permission settings on the\n server side, SSSD allows all authenticated users to login instead of\n denying access.\n\n\nA new boolean setting `ad_gpo_ignore_unreadable` (defaulting to\n `False`) is introduced for environments where attributes in the\n groupPolicyContainer are not readable and changing the permissions\n on the GPO objects is not possible or desirable. See `sssd-ad(5)`.\n* [CVE-2019-3811](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3811)\nIt was discovered that if a user was configured with no home\n directory set, then `sssd(8)` returns `/` (i.e., the root directory)\n instead of the empty string (meaning no home directory). This could\n impact services that restrict the user's filesystem access to within\n their home directory through `chroot()` or similar.\n* [CVE-2021-3621](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3621)\nIt was discovered that the `sssctl(8)` command was vulnerable to shell\n command injection via the `logs-fetch` and `cache-expire`\n subcommands.\n\n\nThis flaw could allows an attacker to trick the root user into\n running a specially crafted `sssctl(8)` command, such as via sudo, in\n order to gain root privileges.\n* [CVE-2022-4254](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-4254)\nIt was discovered that `libsss_certmap` failed to sanitize certificate\n data used in LDAP filters.\n\n\nPKINIT enables a client to authenticate to the KDC using an X.509\n certificate and the corresponding private key, rather than a\n passphrase or keytab. Mapping rules are used in order to map the\n certificate presented during a PKINIT authentication request to the\n corresponding principal. However the mapping filter was found to be\n vulnerable to LDAP filter injection. As the search result is be\n influenced by values in the certificate, which may be attacker\n controlled, this flaw could allow an attacker to gain control of the\n admin account, leading to full domain takeover.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.16.3-3.2+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sssd packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of sssd please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sssd>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
