	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-0386](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0386)\nIt was discovered that under certain conditions the overlayfs\n filesystem implementation did not properly handle copy up\n operations. A local user permitted to mount overlay mounts in user\n namespaces can take advantage of this flaw for local privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2023-31436](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31436)\nGwangun Jung reported a a flaw causing heap out-of-bounds\n read/write errors in the traffic control subsystem for the Quick\n Fair Queueing scheduler (QFQ) which may result in information\n leak, denial of service or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2023-32233](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-32233)\nPatryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered a use-after-free flaw\n in the Netfilter nf\\_tables implementation when processing batch\n requests, which may result in local privilege escalation for a\n user with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability in any user or network\n namespace.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.10.179-1~deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux-5.10 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-5.10>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
