	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-1380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-1380)\nJisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac\n Wi-Fi driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could\n exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of\n service (crash).\n* [CVE-2023-2002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2002)\nRuiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth\n subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local\n Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or\n denial of service (loss of connection).\n* [CVE-2023-2007](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2007)\nLucas Leong (@\\_wmliang\\_) and Reno Robert of Trend Micro Zero Day\n Initiative discovered a time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the\n dpt\\_i2o SCSI controller driver. A local user with access to a\n SCSI device using this driver could exploit this for privilege\n escalation.\n\n\nThis flaw has been mitigated by removing support for the I2OUSRCMD\n operation.\n* [CVE-2023-2269](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2269)\nZheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the\n device mapper implementation may result in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2023-3090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3090)\nIt was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking\n may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in\n denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2023-3111](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3111)\nThe TOTE Robot tool found a flaw in the Btrfs filesystem driver\n that can lead to a use-after-free. It's unclear whether an\n unprivileged user can exploit this.\n* [CVE-2023-3141](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3141)\nA flaw was discovered in the r592 memstick driver that could lead\n to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a\n device. The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2023-3268](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3268)\nIt was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs\n could result in denial of service or an information leak.\n* [CVE-2023-3338](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3338)\nOrnaghi Davide discovered a flaw in the DECnet protocol\n implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference or\n use-after-free. A local user can exploit this to cause a denial\n of service (crash or memory corruption) and probably for privilege\n escalation.\n\n\nThis flaw has been mitigated by removing the DECnet protocol\n implementation.\n* [CVE-2023-20593](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-20593)\nTavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural\n circumstances, a vector register in AMD Zen 2 CPUs may not be\n written to 0 correctly. This flaw allows an attacker to leak\n sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads\n and virtualized guests.\n\n\nFor details please refer to\n <https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html> and\n <https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>.\n\n\nThis issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the\n amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.\n However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides\n updates for second generation EPYC CPUs. Various Ryzen CPUs are\n also affected, but no updates are available yet.\n* [CVE-2023-31084](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31084)\nIt was discovered that the DVB Core driver does not properly\n handle locking of certain events, allowing a local user to cause a\n denial of service.\n* [CVE-2023-32233](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-32233)\nPatryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered a use-after-free flaw\n in the Netfilter nf\\_tables implementation when processing batch\n requests, which may result in local privilege escalation for a\n user with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability in any user or network\n namespace.\n* [CVE-2023-34256](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-34256)\nThe syzbot tool found a time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the\n ext4 filesystem driver. An attacker able to mount a disk image or\n device that they can also write to directly could exploit this to\n cause an out-of-bounds read, possibly resulting in a leak of\n sensitive information or denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2023-35788](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-35788)\nHangyu Hua discovered an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the\n Flower classifier which may result in denial of service or the\n execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2023-35823](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-35823)\nA flaw was discovered in the saa7134 media driver that could lead\n to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a\n device. The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2023-35824](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-35824)\nA flaw was discovered in the dm1105 media driver that could lead\n to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a\n device. The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2023-35828](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-35828)\nA flaw was discovered in the renesas\\_udc USB device-mode driver\n that could lead to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or\n unbound from a device. The security impact of this is unclear.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.19.289-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
