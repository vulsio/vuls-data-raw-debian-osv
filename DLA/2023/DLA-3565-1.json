	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Loofah, a Ruby library for\nHTML/XML transformation and sanitization. An attacker could launch\ncross-site scripting (XSS) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks through\ncrafted HTML/XML documents.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-23514](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23514)\nInefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive\n backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG\n attributes. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU\n resource consumption.\n* [CVE-2022-23515](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23515)\nCross-site scripting via the image/svg+xml media type in data\n URIs.\n* [CVE-2022-23516](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23516)\nLoofah uses recursion for sanitizing CDATA sections, making it\n susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a SystemStackError\n exception. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU\n resource consumption.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.2.3-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-loofah packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of ruby-loofah please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-loofah>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
