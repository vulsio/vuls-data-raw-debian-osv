	"summary": "libapache-mod-jk - security update",
	"details": "\nThe mod\\_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors, an Apache 2 module to\nforward requests from Apache to Tomcat, in some circumstances, such as when\na configuration included \"JkOptions +ForwardDirectories\" but the\nconfiguration did not provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied\nrequests, mod\\_jk would use an implicit mapping and map the request to the\nfirst defined worker. Such an implicit mapping could result in the\nunintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass security constraints\nconfigured in httpd. As of this security update, the implicit mapping\nfunctionality has been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit\nconfiguration. This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod\\_jk only).\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:1.2.46-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-jk packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libapache-mod-jk please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libapache-mod-jk>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
