	],
	"summary": "openvswitch - security update",
	"details": "\nDavid Marchand discovered that Open vSwitch, a multilayer, software-based,\nEthernet virtual switch, was vulnerable to crafted IP packets with ip proto\nset to 0, potentially causing a denial of service.\n\n\nTriggering the vulnerability requires an attacker to send a crafted\nIP packet with protocol field set to `0` and the flow rules\nto contain `set` actions on other fields in the IP protocol\nheader. The resulting flows will omit required actions, and fail to\nmask the IP protocol field, resulting in a large bucket which captures\nall IP packets.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.10.7+ds1-0+deb10u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openvswitch packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openvswitch please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openvswitch>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
