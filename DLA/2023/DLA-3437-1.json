	"details": "\nTwo security issues have been discovered in libssh, a tiny C SSH library, which\nmay allows an remote authenticated user to cause a denial of service or inject\narbitrary commands.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-14889](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14889)\nA flaw was found with the libssh API function ssh\\_scp\\_new() in\n versions before 0.9.3 and before 0.8.8. When the libssh SCP client\n connects to a server, the scp command, which includes a\n user-provided path, is executed on the server-side. In case the\n library is used in a way where users can influence the third\n parameter of the function, it would become possible for an attacker\n to inject arbitrary commands, leading to a compromise of the remote\n target.\n* [CVE-2023-1667](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-1667)\nA NULL pointer dereference was found In libssh during re-keying with\n algorithm guessing. This issue may allow an authenticated client to\n cause a denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.8.7-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libssh please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libssh>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
