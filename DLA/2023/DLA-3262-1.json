	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential cross-site scripting\nvulnerability in smarty3, a widely-used PHP templating engine.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-25047](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-25047)\nIn Smarty before 3.1.47 and 4.x before 4.2.1,\n libs/plugins/function.mailto.php allows XSS. A web page that uses\n smarty\\_function\\_mailto, and that could be parameterized using GET or POST\n input parameters, could allow injection of JavaScript code by a\n user.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.1.33+20180830.1.3a78a21f+selfpack1-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your smarty3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
