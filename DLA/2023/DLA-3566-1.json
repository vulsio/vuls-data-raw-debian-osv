	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Rails HTML Sanitizers, an\nHTML sanitization library for Ruby on Rails applications. An attacker\ncould launch cross-site scripting (XSS) and denial-of-service (DoS)\nattacks through crafted HTML/XML documents.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-23517](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23517)\nCertain configurations use an inefficient regular expression that\n is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to\n sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of\n service through CPU resource consumption.\n* [CVE-2022-23518](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23518)\nCross-site scripting via data URIs when used in combination with\n Loofah >= 2.1.0.\n* [CVE-2022-23519](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23519)\nXSS vulnerability with certain configurations of\n Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if\n the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed\n tags in either of the following ways: allow both math and\n style elements, or allow both svg and style elements.\n* [CVE-2022-23520](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23520)\nXSS vulnerability with certain configurations of\n Rails::Html::Sanitizer due to an incomplete fix of\n [CVE-2022-32209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32209). Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to\n inject content if the application developer has overridden the\n sanitizer's allowed tags to allow both select and style\n elements.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.0.4-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-rails-html-sanitizer packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of ruby-rails-html-sanitizer please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-rails-html-sanitizer>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
