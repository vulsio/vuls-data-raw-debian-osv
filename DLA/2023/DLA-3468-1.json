	"summary": "hsqldb1.8.0 - security update",
	"details": "\nGregor Kopf of Secfault Security GmbH discovered that HSQLDB, a Java SQL\ndatabase engine, allowed the execution of spurious scripting commands in\n.script and .log files. Hsqldb supports a SCRIPT keyword which is\nnormally used to record the commands input by the database admin to output\nsuch a script. In combination with LibreOffice, an attacker could craft an\nodb containing a \"database/script\" file which itself contained a SCRIPT\ncommand where the contents of the file could be written to a new file whose\nlocation was determined by the attacker.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.8.0.10+dfsg-10+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your hsqldb1.8.0 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of hsqldb1.8.0 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/hsqldb1.8.0>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
