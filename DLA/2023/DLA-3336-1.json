	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were found in node-types-url-parse, a Node.js\nmodule used to parse URLs, which may result in authorization bypass or\nredirection to untrusted sites.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-3664](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3664)\nurl-parse mishandles certain uses of a single (back)slash such as\n `https:\\` and `https:/`, and interprets\n the URI as a relative path. Browsers accept a single backslash\n after the protocol, and treat it as a normal slash, while url-parse\n sees it as a relative path. Depending on library usage, this may\n result in allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects,\n or other undesired behavior.\n* [CVE-2021-27515](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27515)\nUsing backslash in the protocol is valid in the browser, while\n url-parse thinks it's a relative path. An application that\n validates a URL using url-parse might pass a malicious link.\n* [CVE-2022-0512](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0512)\nIncorrect handling of username and password can lead to failure to\n properly identify the hostname, which in turn could result in\n authorization bypass.\n* [CVE-2022-0639](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0639)\nIncorrect conversion of `@` characters in protocol in\n the `href` field can lead to lead to failure to properly\n identify the hostname, which in turn could result in authorization\n bypass.\n* [CVE-2022-0686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0686)\nRohan Sharma reported that url-parse is unable to find the correct\n hostname when no port number is provided in the URL, such as in\n `http://example.com:`. This could in turn result in SSRF\n attacks, open redirects or any other vulnerability which depends on\n the `hostname` field of the parsed URL.\n* [CVE-2022-0691](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0691)\nurl-parse is unable to find the correct hostname when the URL\n contains a backspace `\\b` character. This tricks\n the parser into interpreting the URL as a relative path, bypassing\n all hostname checks. It can also lead to false positive in\n `extractProtocol()`.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.2.0-2+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your node-url-parse packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of node-url-parse please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/node-url-parse>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
