	"summary": "python-urllib3 - security update",
	"details": "\nSecurity vulnerabilities were found in python-urllib3, an HTTP library\nwith thread-safe connection pooling for Python, which could lead to\ninformation disclosure or authorization bypass.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-25091](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-25091)\nYoshida Katsuhiko discovered that the fix for [CVE-2018-20060](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20060)\n did not cover non-titlecase request headers; for instance\n â`authorization`â request headers were not removed during\n during cross-origin redirects.\n (Per [RFC7230 sec. 3.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2) header fields are\n to be treated case-insensitively.)\n* [CVE-2019-11236](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11236)\nHanno BĂśck discovered that an attacker controlling the request\n parameter can inject headers by injecting CR/LF chars. The issue is\n similar to CPython's [CVE-2019-9740](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9740).\n* [CVE-2019-11324](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11324)\nChristian Heimes discovered that when verifying HTTPS connections\n upon passing an `SSLContext` to urllib3, system CA certificates are\n loaded into the `SSLContext` by default in addition to any\n manually-specified CA certificates.\n This causes TLS handshakes that should fail given only the manually\n specified certs to succeed based on system CA certs.\n* [CVE-2020-26137](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26137)\nIt was discovered that CRLF injection was possible if the attacker\n controls the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR\n and LF control characters in the first argument of `putrequest()`.\n The issue is similar to urllib's [CVE-2020-26116](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26116).\n* [CVE-2023-43804](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-43804)\nIt was discovered that the `Cookie` request header isn't stripped\n during cross-origin redirects. It is therefore possible for a user\n specifying a `Cookie` header to unknowingly leak information via HTTP\n redirects to a different origin (unless the user disables redirects\n explicitly). The issue is similar to [CVE-2018-20060](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20060), but for `Cookie`\n request header rather than `Authorization`.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.24.1-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-urllib3 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python-urllib3 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-urllib3>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
