	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in Werkzeug, a collection of\nutilities for WSGI (web) applications. An attacker may inject cookies\nin specific situations, and cause a denial of service (DoS).\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-23934](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-23934)\nWerkzeug will parse the cookie `=\\_\\_Host-test=bad` as\n \\_\\_Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a\n vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a\n vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad\n cookie value but the valid cookie key. Browsers may allow\n nameless cookies that look like `=value` instead of\n `key=value`. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised\n application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a\n cookie like `=\\_\\_Host-test=bad` for another subdomain.\n* [CVE-2023-25577](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-25577)\nWerkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited\n number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount\n of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more\n memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint\n that accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or\n `request.get\\_data(parse\\_form\\_data=False)`, it can cause\n unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause\n a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an\n endpoint that will parse it.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.14.1+dfsg1-4+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-werkzeug packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python-werkzeug please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-werkzeug>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
