	"details": "\nDebian Bug : 1001062 1021659\n\n\nMultiple vulnerabilties have been found in freelrdp2, a free implementation of\nthe Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The vulnerabilties potentially allows\nauthentication bypasses on configuration errors, buffer overreads, DoS vectors,\nbuffer overflows or accessing files outside of a shared directory.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-41160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41160)\nIn affected versions a malicious server might trigger out of bound writes in a\n connected client. Connections using GDI or SurfaceCommands to send graphics\n updates to the client might send `0` width/height or out of bound rectangles to\n trigger out of bound writes. With `0` width or heigth the memory allocation\n will be `0` but the missing bounds checks allow writing to the pointer at this\n (not allocated) region.\n* [CVE-2022-24883](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24883)\nPrior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might\n be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid\n `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server\n implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are\n affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use\n custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path\n configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n* [CVE-2022-39282](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39282)\nFreeRDP based clients on unix systems using `/parallel` command line switch\n might read uninitialized data and send it to the server the client is currently\n connected to. FreeRDP based server implementations are not affected.\n* [CVE-2023-39283](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-39283)\nAll FreeRDP based clients when using the `/video` command line switch might\n read uninitialized data, decode it as audio/video and display the result.\n FreeRDP based server implementations are not affected.\n* [CVE-2022-39316](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39316)\nIn affected versions there is an out of bound read in ZGFX decoder component of\n FreeRDP. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read out of\n bound data and try to decode it likely resulting in a crash.\n* [CVE-2022-39318](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39318)\nAffected versions of FreeRDP are missing input validation in `urbdrc` channel.\n A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to crash with division by\n zero.\n* [CVE-2022-39319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39319)\nAffected versions of FreeRDP are missing input length validation in the\n `urbdrc` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read\n out of bound data and send it back to the server.\n* [CVE-2022-39347](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39347)\nAffected versions of FreeRDP are missing path canonicalization and base path\n check for `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client\n to read files outside the shared directory.\n* [CVE-2022-41877](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41877)\nAffected versions of FreeRDP are missing input length validation in `drive`\n channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read out of\n bound data and send it back to the server.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.3.0+dfsg1-2+deb10u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your freerdp2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of freerdp2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/freerdp2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
