	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in ActiveMQ, a Java\nmessage broker.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-13920](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13920)\nApache ActiveMQ uses LocateRegistry.createRegistry() to create the JMX RMI\n registry and binds the server to the jmxrmi entry. It is possible to connect\n to the registry without authentication and call the rebind method to rebind\n jmxrmi to something else. If an attacker creates another server to proxy the\n original, and bound that, he effectively becomes a man in the middle and is\n able to intercept the credentials when an user connects.\n* [CVE-2021-26117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26117)\nThe optional ActiveMQ LDAP login module can be configured to use anonymous\n access to the LDAP server.\n* [CVE-2023-46604](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-46604)\nThe Java OpenWire protocol marshaller is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.\n This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker with network access to either a\n Java-based OpenWire broker or client to run arbitrary shell commands by\n manipulating serialized class types in the OpenWire protocol to cause either\n the client or the broker (respectively) to instantiate any class on the\nclasspath.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.15.16-0+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your activemq packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of activemq please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/activemq>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
