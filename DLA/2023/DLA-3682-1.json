	"summary": "ncurses - security update",
	"details": "\nIssues were found in ncurses, a collection of shared libraries for\nterminal handling, which could lead to denial of service.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-39537](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39537)\nIt has been discovered that the `tic(1)` utility is susceptible to a\n heap overflow on crafted input due to improper bounds checking.\n* [CVE-2023-29491](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-29491)\nJonathan Bar Or, Michael Pearse and Emanuele Cozzi have discovered\n that when ncurses is used by a setuid application, a local user can\n trigger security-relevant memory corruption via malformed data in a\n terminfo database file found in `$HOME/.terminfo` or reached via the\n `TERMINFO` or `TERM` environment variables.\n\n\nIn order to mitigate this issue, ncurses now further restricts\n programs running with elevated privileges (setuid/setgid programs).\n Programs run by the superuser remain able to load custom terminfo\n entries.\n\n\nThis change aligns ncurses' behavior in buster-security with that of\n Debian Bullseye's latest point release (6.2+20201114-2+deb11u2).\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n6.1+20181013-2+deb10u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ncurses packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of ncurses please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ncurses>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
