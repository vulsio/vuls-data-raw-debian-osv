Doorkeeper automatically processed\nauthorization requests without user consent for public clients that have been\npreviously approved, but public clients are inherently vulnerable to\nimpersonation as their identity cannot be assured.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-34246](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-34246)\nDoorkeeper is an OAuth 2 provider for Ruby on Rails / Grape.

This issue is fixed in version 5.6.6.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n4.4.2-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-doorkeeper packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
