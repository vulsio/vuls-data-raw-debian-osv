	"summary": "e2guardian - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential Man In the Middle (MITM)\nvulnerability in e2guardian, a web content filtering engine.\n\n\nValidation of SSL certificates was missing in e2guardian's own MITM\nprevention engine. In standalone mode (ie. acting as a proxy or a transparent\nproxy) with SSL MITM enabled, e2guardian did not validate hostnames in\ncertificates of the web servers that it connected to, and thus was itself\nvulnerable to MITM attacks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-44273](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44273)\ne2guardian v5.4.x <= v5.4.3r is affected by missing SSL certificate\n validation in the SSL MITM engine. In standalone mode (i.e., acting as a\n proxy or a transparent proxy), with SSL MITM enabled, e2guardian, if built\n with OpenSSL v1.1.x, did not validate hostnames in certificates of the web\n servers that it connected to, and thus was itself vulnerable to MITM\n attacks.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n5.3.1-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your e2guardian packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
