	"summary": "python-git - security update",
	"details": "\nSantos Gallegos discovered a blind local file inclusion in python-git, a\nPython library to interact with Git repositories, which could lead to\ndenial of service or potentially information disclosure.\n\n\nIn order to resolve some git references, python-git reads files from the\n\"`.git`\" directory but, due to improper location check, an\nattacker can pass a file located outside this directory thereby making\npython-git read arbitrary file on the system.\n\n\nIt remains unclear whether the attacker can gain access to actual file\ncontent, but denial of service can be achieved by passing a large or\ninfinite file such as `/dev/random`.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.1.11-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-git packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python-git please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-git>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
