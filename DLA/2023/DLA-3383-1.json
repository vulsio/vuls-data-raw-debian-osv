	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential local privilege escalation in\nGruntJS, a multipurpose task runner and build system tool.\n\n\n`file.copy` operations in GruntJS were vulnerable to a TOCTOU\n(\"time-of-check vs. time-of-use\") race condition that could have led to\narbitrary file writes in GitHub repositories. This could have then led to local\nprivilege escalation if a lower-privileged user had write access to both source\nand destination directories, as the lower-privileged user could have created a\nsymlink to the GruntJS user's `~/.bashrc` configuration file\n(etc).\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-1537](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1537)\nfile.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race\n condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository\n gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary\n file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS\n user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and\n destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink\n to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the\n GruntJS user is root.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.0.1-8+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your grunt packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
