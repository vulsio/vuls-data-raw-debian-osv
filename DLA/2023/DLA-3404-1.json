	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information\nleak.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-2196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2196)\nA regression was discovered the KVM implementation for Intel CPUs,\n affecting Spectre v2 mitigation for nested virtualisation. When\n KVM was used as the L0 hypervisor, an L2 guest could exploit this\n to leak sensitive information from its L1 hypervisor.\n* [CVE-2022-3424](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3424)\nZheng Wang and Zhuorao Yang reported a flaw in the SGI GRU driver\n which could lead to a use-after-free. On systems where this driver\n is used, a local user can explit this for denial of service (crash\n or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2022-3707](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3707)\nZheng Wang reported a flaw in the i915 graphics driver's\n virtualisation (GVT-g) support that could lead to a double-free.\n On systems where this feature is used, a guest can exploit this\n for denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-4129](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-4129)\nHaowei Yan reported a race condition in the L2TP protocol\n implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A\n local user could exploit this for denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2022-4379](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-4379)\nXingyuan Mo reported a flaw in the NFSv4.2 inter server to\n server copy implementation which could lead to a use-after-free.\n\n\nThis feature is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2023-0045](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0045)\nRodrigo Branco and Rafael Correa De Ysasi reported that when a\n user-space task told the kernel to enable Spectre v2 mitigation\n for it, the mitigation was not enabled until the task was next\n rescheduled. This might be exploitable by a local or remote\n attacker to leak sensitive information from such an application.\n* [CVE-2023-0458](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0458)\nJordy Zimmer and Alexandra Sandulescu found that getrlimit() and\n related system calls were vulnerable to speculative execution\n attacks such as Spectre v1. A local user could explot this to\n leak sensitive information from the kernel.\n* [CVE-2023-0459](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0459)\nJordy Zimmer and Alexandra Sandulescu found a regression in\n Spectre v1 mitigation in the user-copy functions for the amd64\n (64-bit PC) architecture. Where the CPUs do not implement SMAP or\n it is disabled, a local user could exploit this to leak sensitive\n information from the kernel. Other architectures may also be\n affected.\n* [CVE-2023-0461](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0461)\nslipper reported a flaw in the kernel's support for ULPs (Upper\n Layer Protocols) on top of TCP that can lead to a double-free when\n using kernel TLS sockets.
