	"details": "\nA flaw was found in Asterisk, an Open Source Private Branch Exchange. A\nbuffer overflow vulnerability affects users that use PJSIP DNS resolver.\nThis vulnerability is related to [CVE-2022-24793](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24793). The difference is that\nthis issue is in parsing the query record `parse\\_query()`, while the issue\nin [CVE-2022-24793](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24793) is in `parse\\_rr()`. A workaround is to disable DNS\nresolution in PJSIP config (by setting `nameserver\\_count` to zero) or use\nan external resolver implementation instead.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of asterisk please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/asterisk>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
