A call to db\\_stop was missing from the\npost-installation script which meant that, under some configurations, the\nscript would hang indefinitely.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.3.2-6+deb10u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your opendmarc packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
