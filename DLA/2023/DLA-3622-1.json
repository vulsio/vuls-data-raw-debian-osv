	"summary": "axis - security update",
	"details": "\nLetian Yuan discovered a flaw in Apache Axis 1.x, a SOAP implementation written\nin Java. It may not have been obvious that looking up a service through\nServiceFactory.getService allows potentially dangerous lookup mechanisms such\nas LDAP. When passing untrusted input to this API method, this could expose the\napplication to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading to remote code execution.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.4-28+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your axis packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of axis please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/axis>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
