	"details": "\nMatthieu Barjole and Victor Cutillas discovered that sudoedit in sudo, a\nprogram designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific\nusers, does not properly handle '--' to separate the editor and arguments\nfrom files to edit. A local user permitted to edit certain files can take\nadvantage of this flaw to edit a file not permitted by the security\npolicy, resulting in privilege escalation.\n\n\nMore information can be found at:\n<https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/sudoedit_any/>\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.8.27-1+deb10u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of sudo please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
