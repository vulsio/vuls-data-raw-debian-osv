setting a password for password-protected PDF files. The\n user-controlled password was not properly escaped/sanitized and it was\n therefore possible to inject additional shell commands via\n coders/pdf.c. On debian system, by default the imagemagick policy\n mitigate this CVE.\n* [CVE-2021-3574](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3574)\nA memory leak was found converting a crafted TIFF file.\n* [CVE-2021-3596](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3596)\nA NULL pointer dereference was found in ReadSVGImage() in\n coders/svg.c\n* [CVE-2021-20224](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20224)\nAn integer overflow issue was discovered in ImageMagick's\n ExportIndexQuantum() function in MagickCore/quantum-export.c.\n* [CVE-2022-44267](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-44267)\nA Denial of Service was found. When it parses a PNG image,\n the convert process could be left waiting for stdin input.\n* [CVE-2022-44268](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-44268)\nAn Information Disclosure was found. When it parses a PNG image,\n (e.g., for resize), the resulting image could have embedded\n the content of an arbitrary. file.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n8:6.9.10.23+dfsg-2.1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of imagemagick please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/imagemagick>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
