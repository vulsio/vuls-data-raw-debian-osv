	"details": "\nMultiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities were found in pcre2, a Perl\nCompatible Regular Expression library, which could result in information\ndisclosure or denial or service.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-20454](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20454)\nOut-of-bounds read when the pattern `\\X` is JIT\n compiled and used to match specially crafted subjects in non-UTF\n mode.\n* [CVE-2022-1586](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1586)\nOut-of-bounds read involving unicode property matching in\n JIT-compiled regular expressions. The issue occurs because the\n character was not fully read in case-less matching within JIT.\n* [CVE-2022-1587](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1587)\nOut-of-bounds read affecting recursions in JIT-compiled regular\n expressions caused by duplicate data transfers.\n\n\nThis upload also fixes a subject buffer overread in JIT when UTF is\ndisabled and `\\X` or `\\R` has a greater\nthan 1 fixed quantifier. This issue was found by Yunho Kim.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n10.32-5+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pcre2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of pcre2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pcre2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
