	"summary": "node-xmldom - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that node-xmldom, a standard XML DOM (Level2 CORE)\nimplementation in pure javascript, processed ill-formed XML, which may\nresult in bugs and security holes in downstream applications.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-21366](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-21366)\nxmldom versions 0.4.0 and older do not correctly preserve system\n identifiers, FPIs or namespaces when repeatedly parsing and serializing\n maliciously crafted documents. This may lead to unexpected syntactic\n changes during XML processing in some downstream applications.\n* [CVE-2022-39353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39353)\nMark Gollnick discovered that xmldom parses XML that is not well-formed\n because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to\n the `childNodes` collection of the `Document`, without reporting or throwing\n any error. This breaks the assumption that there is only a single root node\n in the tree, and may open security holes such as [CVE-2022-39299](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39299) in\n downstream applications.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.1.27+ds-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your node-xmldom packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of node-xmldom please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/node-xmldom>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
