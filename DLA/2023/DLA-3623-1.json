	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-4269](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-4269)\nWilliam Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)\n subsystem when using a specific networking configuration\n (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action mirred),\n may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service\n (triggering a CPU soft lockup).\n* [CVE-2022-39189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39189)\nJann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in\n the KVM subsystem in certain KVM\\_VCPU\\_PREEMPTED situations, which\n may allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest\n kernel.\n* [CVE-2023-1206](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-1206)\nIt was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to\n force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which\n may result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost\n of lookups, increased CPU utilization).\n* [CVE-2023-1380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-1380)\nJisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac\n Wi-Fi driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could\n exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of\n service.\n* [CVE-2023-2002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2002)\nRuiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth\n subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local\n Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or\n denial of service (loss of connection).\n* [CVE-2023-2007](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2007)\nLucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a\n time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the dpt\\_i2o SCSI controller\n driver.
