	"details": "\nIt was discovered that node-object-path, a Node.js module to access deep\nobject properties using dot-separated paths, was vulnerable to prototype\npollution.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-3805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3805)\nPrototype pollution vulnerability in the `del()`, `empty()`,\n `push()` and `insert()` functions when using the inherited props\n mode (e.g. when a new `object-path` instance is created with the\n `includeInheritedProps` option set to `true` or when using the\n `withInheritedProps` default instance).\n* [CVE-2021-23434](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23434)\nA type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of the\n [CVE-2020-15256](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-15256) fix when the path components used in the path\n parameter are arrays, because the `===` operator returns always `false`\n when the type of the operands is different.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.11.4-2+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your node-object-path packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of node-object-path please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/node-object-path>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
