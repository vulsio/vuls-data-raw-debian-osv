	],
	"summary": "cjose - security update",
	"details": "\nAn incorrect Authentication Tag length usage was discovered in cjose, a\nC library implementing the Javascript Object Signing and Encryption\n(JOSE) standard, which could lead to integrity compromise.\n\n\nThe AES GCM decryption routine incorrectly uses the Tag length from the\nactual Authentication Tag as provided in the JSON Web Encryption (JWE)\nobject, while the [specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518#section-4.7)\nsays that a fixed length of 16 octets\nmust be applied. This could allows an attacker to provide a truncated\nAuthentication Tag and to modify the JWE accordingly.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.6.1+dfsg1-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cjose packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of cjose please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cjose>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
