A malicious CA could take\n advantage of this flaw to deliberately assert invalid certificate\n policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate\n altogether.\n* [CVE-2023-0466](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0466)\nDavid Benjamin discovered that the implementation of the\n X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_add0\\_policy() function does not enable the check\n which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to\n pass the certificate verification (contrary to its documentation).\n* [CVE-2023-2650](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2650)\nIt was discovered that processing malformed ASN.1 object\n identifiers or data may result in denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.1.1n-0+deb10u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openssl please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssl>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
