	"details": "\nSecurity issues were discovered in inetutils, a collection of GNU\nnetwork utilities, which could lead to privilege escalation or\npotentially execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-0053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0053)\nThorsten Alteholz discovered that [CVE-2019-0053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0053) was patched\n incorrectly in inetutils 2:1.9.4-7+deb10u2. The original\n vulnerability remained: inetutils' telnet client doesn't\n sufficiently validate environment variables, which can lead to\n stack-based buffer overflows. (This issue is limited to local\n exploitation from restricted shells.)\n* [CVE-2023-40303](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-40303)\nJeffrey Bencteux discovered that several `setuid()`, `setgid()`,\n `seteuid()` and `setguid()` return values were not checked in\n ftpd/rcp/rlogin/rsh/rshd/uucpd code, which may lead to privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2:1.9.4-7+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your inetutils packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of inetutils please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/inetutils>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
