	"details": "\nMoment.js is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating,\nmanipulating, and formatting dates. A couple of vulnerabilities\nwere reported as follows:\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-24785](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24785)\nA path traversal vulnerability impacts npm (server) users of\n Moment.js, especially if a user-provided locale string is directly\n used to switch moment locale.\n* [CVE-2022-31129](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-31129)\nAffected versions of moment were found to use an inefficient\n parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing in\n moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by\n default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users\n may notice a noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k\n characters. Users who pass user-provided strings without sanity\n length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS\n attacks.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.24.0+ds-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your node-moment packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of node-moment please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/node-moment>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
