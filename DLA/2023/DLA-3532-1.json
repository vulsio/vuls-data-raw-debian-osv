	"summary": "openssh - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled loading certain\nPKCS#11 providers. If a user forwarded their ssh-agent to an untrusted\nsystem, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to load\narbitrary libraries from the userâs system and execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nIn addition to the above security issue, this update also fixed\nanother bug - bad interaction between the ssh\\_config ConnectTimeout\nand ConnectionAttempts directives - connection attempts after the\nfirst attempt were ignoring the requested timeout. More details about\nthis can be found at <https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id)18.>\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:7.9p1-10+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openssh please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssh>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
