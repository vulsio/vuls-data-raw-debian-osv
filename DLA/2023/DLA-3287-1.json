	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities were found in lemonldap-ng, an OpenID-Connect, CAS\nand SAML compatible Web-SSO system, that could result in information\ndisclosure or impersonation.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-16093](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-16093)\nMaxime Besson discovered that LemonLDAP::NG before 2.0.9 did not\n check validity of the X.509 certificate by default when connecting\n to remote LDAP backends, because the default configuration of the\n Net::LDAPS module for Perl is used.\n\n\nThis update changes the default behavior to require X.509 validation\n against the distribution bundle `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.\n Previous behavior can reverted by running\n `/usr/share/lemonldap-ng/bin/lemonldap-ng-cli set ldapVerify none`.\n\n\nIf a session backend is set to Apache::Session::LDAP or\n Apache::Session::Browseable::LDAP, then the complete fix involves\n upgrading the corresponding Apache::Session module\n (libapache-session-ldap-perl resp. libapache-session-browseable-perl)\n to 0.4-1+deb10u1 (or âĽ0.5) resp. 1.3.0-1+deb10u1 (or âĽ1.3.8). See\n related advisories [DLA-3284-1](dla-3284) and\n [DLA-3285-1](dla-3285) for details.\n* [CVE-2022-37186](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-37186)\nMickael Bride discovered that under certain conditions the session\n remained valid on handlers after being destroyed on portal.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.0.2+ds-7+deb10u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lemonldap-ng packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of lemonldap-ng please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/lemonldap-ng>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
