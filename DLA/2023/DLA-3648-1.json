This flaw resulted in a small time window whereby\nnewly-generated private keys were readable by other processes on the same\nmachine.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-1672](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-1672)\nA race condition exists in the Tang server functionality for key\n generation and key rotation. This flaw results in a small time window where\n Tang private keys become readable by other processes on the same\n host.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n7-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tang packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
