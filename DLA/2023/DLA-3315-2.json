	"summary": "sox - regression update",
	"details": "\nThis update fixes multiple file format validation vulnerabilities that could\nresult in memory access violations such as buffer overflows and floating point\nexceptions. It also fixes a regression in hcom parsing introduced when fixing\n[CVE-2017-11358](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11358).\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-13590](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13590)\nIn `sox-fmt.h` (startread function), there is an integer overflow on the\n result of integer addition (wraparound to 0) fed into the `lsx_calloc` macro\n that wraps `malloc`. When a `NULL` pointer is returned, it is used without a\n prior check that it is a valid pointer, leading to a `NULL` pointer\n dereference on `lsx_readbuf` in `formats_i.c`.\n* [CVE-2021-3643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3643)\nThe `lsx_adpcm_init` function within libsox leads to a\n global-buffer-overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a malicious\n file, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2021-23159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23159)\nA vulnerability was found in SoX, where a heap-buffer-overflow occurs\n in function `lsx_read_w_buf()` in `formats_i.c` file. The vulnerability is\n exploitable with a crafted file, that could cause an application to\n crash.\n* [CVE-2021-23172](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23172)\nA vulnerability was found in SoX, where a heap-buffer-overflow occurs\n in function `startread()` in `hcom.c` file. The vulnerability is\n exploitable with a crafted hcomn file, that could cause an application\n to crash.\n* [CVE-2021-23210](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23210)\nA floating point exception (divide-by-zero) issue was discovered in\n SoX in functon `read_samples()` of `voc.c` file. An attacker with a\n crafted file, could cause an application to crash.\n* [CVE-2021-33844](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33844)\nA floating point exception (divide-by-zero) issue was discovered in\n SoX in functon `startread()` of `wav.c` file. An attacker with a crafted\n wav file, could cause an application to crash.\n* [CVE-2021-40426](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-40426)\nA heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `sphere.c`\n`start_read()` functionality of Sound Exchange libsox. A specially-crafted\n file can lead to a heap buffer overflow. An attacker can provide a\n malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n* [CVE-2022-31650](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-31650)\nThere is a floating-point exception in `lsx_aiffstartwrite` in `aiff.c`.\n* [CVE-2022-31651](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-31651)\nThere is an assertion failure in `rate_init` in `rate.c`.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n14.4.2+git20190427-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of sox please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sox>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
