	"details": "\nIt was discovered that when using the get\\_post\\_logout\\_redirect and\nget\\_post\\_login\\_redirect functions in flask-security, an implementation of\nsimple security for Flask apps, it is possible to bypass URL validation and\nredirect a user to an arbitrary URL by providing multiple back slashes such as\n\\\\\\evil.com/path.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is exploitable only if an alternative WSGI server other\nthan Werkzeug is used, or the default behaviour of Werkzeug is modified using\n'autocorrect\\_location\\_header√∫lse.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.7.5-2+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your flask-security packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of flask-security please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/flask-security>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
