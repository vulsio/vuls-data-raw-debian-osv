Ghost domain names includes expired domains\n and taken-down malicious domains.\n* [CVE-2023-31137](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31137)\nThe authoritative server in MaraDNS had an issue where it is\n possible to remotely terminate the MaraDNS process with a\n specialy crafted packet (so called packet of death).\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.0.13-1.2+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your maradns packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of maradns please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/maradns>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
