	"summary": "netatalk - security update",
	"details": "\nFlorent Saudel and Arnaud Gatignol discovered a Type Confusion\nvulnerability in the Spotlight RPC functions in afpd in Netatalk. When\nparsing Spotlight RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value\nstyle dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can\nbe any of the supported types in the underlying protocol. Due to a lack of\ntype checking in callers of the dalloc\\_value\\_for\\_key() function, which\nreturns the object associated with a key, a malicious actor may be able to\nfully control the value of the pointer and theoretically achieve Remote\nCode Execution on the host.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.1.12~ds-3+deb10u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your netatalk packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of netatalk please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/netatalk>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
