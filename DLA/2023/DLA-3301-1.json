	"summary": "cinder - security update",
	"details": "\nAn issue was discovered in OpenStack Cinder, a Block Storage service\nfor OpenStack. By supplying a specially created VMDK flat image that\nreferences a specific backing file path, an authenticated user may\nconvince systems to return a copy of that file's contents from the\nserver, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n2:13.0.7-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cinder packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of cinder please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cinder>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
