	"summary": "orthanc - security update",
	"details": "\nA security vulnerability was identified in Orthanc, a DICOM server used for\nmedical imaging, whereby authenticated API users had the capability to overwrite\narbitrary files and, in certain configurations, execute unauthorized code.\n\n\nThis update addresses the issue by backporting a safeguard mechanism: the\nRestApiWriteToFileSystemEnabled option is now included, and it is set to true\nby default in the /etc/orthanc/orthanc.json configuration file. Should users\nwish to revert to the previous behavior, they can manually set this option\nto true themselves.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.5.6+dfsg-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your orthanc packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of orthanc please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/orthanc>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
