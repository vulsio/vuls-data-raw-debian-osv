If parsing\n user input, this may be used as a denial of service vector.\n* [CVE-2022-3064](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3064)\nParsing malicious or large YAML documents can consume excessive\n amounts of CPU or memory.\n\n\nThanks to Scarlett Moore for working on preparing this update.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.2.2-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your golang-yaml.v2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of golang-yaml.v2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-yaml.v2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
