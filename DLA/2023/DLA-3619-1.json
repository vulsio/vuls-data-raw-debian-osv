A malicious SVG could trigger loading external resources\n by default, causing resource consumption or in some\n cases even information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2022-44730](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-44730)\nA Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability\n was found. A malicious SVG can probe user profile / data and send\n it directly as parameter to a URL.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.10-2+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your batik packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of batik please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/batik>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
