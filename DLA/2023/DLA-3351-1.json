	"details": "\nMultiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache HTTP\nserver.\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-20001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-20001)\nA carefully crafted If: request header can cause a memory read, or write\nof a single zero byte, in a pool (heap) memory location beyond the header\nvalue sent. This could cause the process to crash.\n* [CVE-2021-33193](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33193)\nA crafted method sent through HTTP/2 will bypass validation and be\nforwarded by mod\\_proxy, which can lead to request splitting or cache\npoisoning.\n* [CVE-2022-36760](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-36760)\nInconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')\nvulnerability in mod\\_proxy\\_ajp of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to\nsmuggle requests to the AJP server it forwards requests to.\n* [CVE-2022-37436](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-37436)\nA malicious backend can cause the response headers to be truncated early,\nresulting in some headers being incorporated into the response body. If\nthe later headers have any security purpose, they will not be interpreted\nby the client.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.4.38-3+deb10u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
