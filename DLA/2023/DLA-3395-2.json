	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the Go programming\nlanguage. An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS), invalid\ncryptographic computation, information leak, or arbitrary code\nexecution on the developer's computer in specific situations.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-28367](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-28367)\nCode injection in the go command with cgo allows arbitrary code\n execution at build time via malicious gcc flags specified via a\n #cgo directive.\n* [CVE-2021-33196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33196)\nIn archive/zip, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can\n cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.\n* [CVE-2021-36221](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-36221)\nGo has a race condition that can lead to a net/http/httputil\n ReverseProxy panic upon an ErrAbortHandler abort.\n* [CVE-2021-38297](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38297)\nGo has a Buffer Overflow via large arguments in a function\n invocation from a WASM module, when GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js is used.\n* [CVE-2021-39293](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39293)\nThis issue exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2021-33196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33196).\n* [CVE-2021-41771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41771)\nImportedSymbols in debug/macho (for Open or OpenFat) Accesses a\n Memory Location After the End of a Buffer, aka an out-of-bounds\n slice situation.\n* [CVE-2021-44716](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44716)\nnet/http allows uncontrolled memory consumption in the header\n canonicalization cache via HTTP/2 requests.\n* [CVE-2021-44717](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44717)\nGo on UNIX allows write operations to an unintended file or\n unintended network connection as a consequence of erroneous\n closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion.\n* [CVE-2022-23806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23806)\nCurve.IsOnCurve in crypto/elliptic can incorrectly return true in\n situations with a big.Int value that is not a valid field element.\n* [CVE-2022-24921](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24921)\nregexp.Compile allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested\n expression.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.11.6-1+deb10u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.11 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of golang-1.11 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-1.11>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
