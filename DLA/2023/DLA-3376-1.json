	"details": "\nMultiple security issues were discovered in svgpp: a C++ library for parsing and\nrendering Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-44960](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44960)\nThe XMLDocument::getRoot function in the renderDocument function handled the\n XMLDocument object improperly. Specifically, it returned a null pointer\n prematurely at the second if statement, resulting in a null pointer\n reference behind the renderDocument function.\n* [CVE-2019-6245](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6245)\nand [CVE-2019-6247](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6247):\n issues were discovered in Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) within the function\n agg::cell\\_aa::not\\_equal. Since svgpp is a header-only library, the issue is\n only transitive in theory. As a result, only a dependency version hardening\n has been added to the control file.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.2.3+dfsg1-6+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your svgpp packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of svgpp please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/svgpp>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
