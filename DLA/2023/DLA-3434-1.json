NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix\n for [CVE-2022-39377](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39377).\n\n\nFor reference, the initial vulnerability was:\n* [CVE-2022-39377](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39377)\nOn 32 bit systems, allocate\\_structures contains a size\\_t overflow\n in sa\\_common.c. The allocate\\_structures function insufficiently\n checks bounds before arithmetic multiplication, allowing for an\n overflow in the size allocated for the buffer representing system\n activities. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n12.0.3-2+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sysstat packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of sysstat please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sysstat>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
