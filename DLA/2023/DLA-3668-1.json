	"details": "\nVulnerabilities were found in opensc, a set of libraries and utilities\nto access smart cards, which could lead to application crash or\nauthentication bypass.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-40660](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-40660)\nWhen the token/card was plugged into the computer and authenticated\n from one process, it could be used to provide cryptographic\n operations from different process when the empty, zero-length PIN\n and the token can track the login status using some of its\n internals. This is dangerous for OS logon/screen unlock and small\n tokens that are plugged permanently to the computer.\n\n\nThe bypass was removed and explicit logout implemented for most of\n the card drivers to prevent leaving unattended logged-in tokens.\n* [CVE-2023-40661](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-40661)\nThis advisory summarizes automatically reported issues from dynamic\n analyzers reports in pkcs15-init that are security relevant.\n\n\n\n\t+ stack buffer overflow in `sc_pkcs15_get_lastupdate()` in pkcs15init;\n\t+ heap buffer overflow in `setcos_create_key()` in pkcs15init;\n\t+ heap buffer overflow in `cosm_new_file()` in pkcs15init;\n\t+ stack buffer overflow in `cflex_delete_file()` in pkcs15init;\n\t+ heap buffer overflow in `sc_hsm_write_ef()` in pkcs15init;\n\t+ stack buffer overflow while parsing pkcs15 profile files;\n\t+ stack buffer overflow in muscle driver in pkcs15init; and\n\t+ stack buffer overflow in cardos driver in pkcs15init.\n\n\nAll of these require physical access to the computer at the time\n user or administrator would be enrolling the cards (generating keys\n and loading certificates, other card/token management) operations.\n The attack requires crafted USB device or smart card that would\n present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs so\n they are considered a high-complexity and low-severity. This issue\n is not exploitable just by using a PKCS#11 module as done in most of\n the end-user deployments.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.19.0-1+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your opensc packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of opensc please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/opensc>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
