	"summary": "otrs2 - security update",
	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were found in otrs2, the Open-Source Ticket\nRequest System, which could lead to impersonation, denial of service,\ninformation disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-11358](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11358)\nA Prototype Pollution vulnerability was discovered in OTRS' embedded\n jQuery 3.2.1 copy, which could allow sending drafted messages as\n wrong agent.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-05.\n* [CVE-2019-12248](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12248)\nMatthias Terlinde discovered that when an attacker sends a malicious\n email to an OTRS system and a logged in agent user later quotes it,\n the email could cause the browser to load external image resources.\n\n\nA new configuration setting `Ticket::Frontend::BlockLoadingRemoteContent`\n has been added as part of the fix. It controls whether external\n content should be loaded, and it is disabled by default.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-08.\n* [CVE-2019-12497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12497)\nJens Meister discovered that in the customer or external frontend,\n personal information of agents, like Name and mail address in\n external notes, could be disclosed.\n\n\nNew configuration settings `Ticket::Frontend::CustomerTicketZoom###DisplayNoteFrom`\n has been added as part of the fix. It controls if agent information\n should be displayed in external note sender field, or be substituted\n with a different generic name. Another option named\n `Ticket::Frontend::CustomerTicketZoom###DefaultAgentName` can then\n be used to define the generic agent name used in the latter case.\n By default, previous behavior is preserved, in which agent\n information is divulged in the external note From field, for the\n sake of backwards compatibility.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-09.\n* [CVE-2019-12746](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12746)\nA user logged into OTRS as an agent might unknowingly disclose their\n session ID by sharing the link of an embedded ticket article with\n third parties. This identifier can be then potentially abused in\n order to impersonate the agent user.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-10.\n* [CVE-2019-13458](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13458)\nAn attacker who is logged into OTRS as an agent user with\n appropriate permissions can leverage OTRS tags in templates in order\n to disclose hashed user passwords.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-12.\n* [CVE-2019-16375](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16375)\nAn attacker who is logged into OTRS as an agent or customer user\n with appropriate permissions can create a carefully crafted string\n containing malicious JavaScript code as an article body. This\n malicious code is executed when an agent compose an answer to the\n original article.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-13.\n* [CVE-2019-18179](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18179)\nAn attacker who is logged into OTRS as an agent is able to list\n tickets assigned to other agents, which are in the queue where\n attacker doesn't have permissions.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-14.\n* [CVE-2019-18180](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18180)\nOTRS can be put into an endless loop by providing filenames with\n overly long extensions. This applies to the PostMaster (sending in\n email) and also upload (attaching files to mails, for example).\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-15.\n* [CVE-2020-1765](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1765)\nSebastian Renker and Jonas Becker discovered an improper control of\n parameters, which allows the spoofing of the From fields in several\n screens, namely AgentTicketCompose, AgentTicketForward,\n AgentTicketBounce and AgentTicketEmailOutbound.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-01.\n* [CVE-2020-1766](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1766)\nAnton Astaf'ev discovered that due to improper handling of uploaded\n images, it is possible â in very unlikely and rare conditions â to\n force the agents browser to execute malicious JavaScript from a\n special crafted SVG file rendered as inline jpg file.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-02.\n* [CVE-2020-1767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1767)\nAgent A is able to save a draft (i.e., for customer reply). Then\n Agent B can open the draft, change the text completely and send it\n in the name of Agent A. For the customer it will not be visible\n that the message was sent by another agent.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-03.\n* [CVE-2020-1769](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1769)\nMartin MĂ¸ller discovered that in the login screens (in agent and\n customer interface), Username and Password fields use autocomplete,\n which might be considered as security issue.\n\n\nA new configuration setting `DisableLoginAutocomplete` has been\n added as part of the fix. It controls whether to disable\n autocompletion in the login forms, by setting the\n `autocomplete=\"off\"` attribute to the login input fields. Note that\n some browsers ignore it by default (usually it can be changed in the\n browser configuration).\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-06.\n* [CVE-2020-1770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1770)\nMatthias Terlinde discovered that the support bundle generated files\n could contain sensitive information, such as user credentials.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-07.\n* [CVE-2020-1771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1771)\nChristoph Wuetschne discovered that an attacker is able craft an\n article with a link to the customer address book with malicious\n content (JavaScript). When agent opens the link, JavaScript code is\n executed due to the missing parameter encoding.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-08.\n* [CVE-2020-1772](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1772)\nFabian Henneke discovered that it is possible to craft Lost Password\n requests with wildcards in the Token value, which allows an attacker\n to retrieve valid Token(s), generated by users which already\n requested new passwords.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-09.\n* [CVE-2020-1773](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1773)\nFabian Henneke discovered that an attacker with the ability to\n generate session IDs or password reset tokens, either by being able\n to authenticate or by exploiting [CVE-2020-1772](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1772), may be able to\n predict other users session IDs, password reset tokens and\n automatically generated passwords.\n\n\nThe fix adds `libmath-random-secure-perl` to otrs2's\n Depends: field.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-10.\n* [CVE-2020-1774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1774)\nWhen a user downloads PGP or S/MIME keys/certificates, exported file\n has same name for private and public keys. It is therefore possible\n to mix them and to send private key to the third-party instead of\n public key.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-11.\n* [CVE-2020-1776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1776)\nWhen an agent user is renamed or set to invalid the session\n belonging to the user is keept active. The session can not be used\n to access ticket data in the case the agent is invalid.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-13.\n* [CVE-2020-11022](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11022)\nMasato Kinugawa discovered a Potential XSS vulnerability in OTRS'\n embedded jQuery 3.2.1's htmlPrefilter and related methods.\n\n\nThe fix requires patching embedded copies of fullcalendar (3.4.0),\n fullcalendar-scheduler (1.6.2) and spectrum (1.8.0).\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-14.\n* [CVE-2020-11023](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11023)\nMasato Kinugawa discovered a Potential XSS vulnerability in OTRS'\n embedded jQuery 3.2.1 copy when appending HTML containing option\n elements.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-14.\n* [CVE-2021-21252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-21252)\nErik Krogh Kristensen and Alvaro MuĂąoz from the GitHub Security Lab\n team discovered a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\n vulnerability in OTRS' embedded jQuery-validate 1.16.0 copy.\n* [CVE-2021-21439](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-21439)\nA Denial of Service (DoS) attack can be performed when an email\n contains specially designed URL in the body. It can lead to the\n high CPU usage and cause low quality of service, or in extreme case\n bring the system to a halt.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is also known as OSA-2021-09 or ZSA-2021-03.\n* [CVE-2021-21440](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-21440)\nJulian Droste and Mathias Terlinde discovered that the Generated\n Support Bundles contains private S/MIME and PGP keys when the parent\n directory is not hidden.
