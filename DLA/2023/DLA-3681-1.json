	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilties have been found in Amanda,a backup system\ndesigned to archive many computers on a network to a single\nlarge-capacity tape drive. The vulnerabilties potentially allows local\nprivilege escalation from the backup user to root or leak information\nwhether a directory exists in the filesystem.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-37703](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-37703)\nIn Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in the\n calcsize SUID binary. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to\n know if a directory exists or not anywhere in the fs. The binary\n will use `opendir()` as root directly without checking the path,\n letting the attacker provide an arbitrary path.\n* [CVE-2022-37705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-37705)\nA privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the\n backup user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is\n the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with\n specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This\n program mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary.\n* [CVE-2023-30577](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-30577)\nThe SUID binary runtar can accept the possibly malicious GNU tar\n options if fed with some non-argument option starting with\n \"--exclude\" (say --exclude-vcs). The following option will be\n accepted as good and it could be an option passing some\n script/binary that would be executed with root permissions.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:3.5.1-2+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your amanda packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of amanda please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/amanda>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
