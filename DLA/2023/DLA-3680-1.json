	"details": "\nAn issue ([CVE-2022-48521](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-48521)) was discovered in OpenDKIM through 2.10.3, and\n2.11.x through 2.11.0-Beta2. It fails to keep track of ordinal numbers\nwhen removing fake Authentication-Results header fields, which allows a\nremote attacker to craft an e-mail message with a fake sender address\nsuch that programs that rely on Authentication-Results from OpenDKIM\nwill treat the message as having a valid DKIM signature when in fact it\nhas none.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.11.0~alpha-12+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your opendkim packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of opendkim please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/opendkim>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
