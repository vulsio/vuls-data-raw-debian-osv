	"summary": "wordpress - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been addressed in Wordpress, a\npopular content management framework.\n\n\nWordPress Core is vulnerable to Directory Traversal via the wp\\_lang\nparameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access and load arbitrary\ntranslation files. In cases where an attacker is able to upload a crafted\ntranslation file onto the site, such as via an upload form, this could be also\nused to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n5.0.19+dfsg1-0+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wordpress>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
