	"details": "\nIt has been found that the update of freerdp2 (see DLA-3606-1) exposed a\nbug in vinagre, which causes crashes and breaks RDP connections with the\nsymtoms of hangs and black screens.\n**Note**: sha256 is now used instead of sha1 to fingerprint certificates. This will\ninvalidate all hosts in FreeRDP known\\_hosts2 file, $HOME/.config/freerdp/known\\_hosts2.\nIn case of problems with the connection, try removing that file.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.22.0-6+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your vinagre packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of vinagre please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/vinagre>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n\n\n",
