	"details": "\nJacob Champion discovered that libpq can leak memory contents after\nGSSAPI transport encryption initiation fails.\n\n\nA modified server, or an unauthenticated man-in-the-middle, can send a\nnot-zero-terminated error message during setup of GSSAPI (Kerberos)\ntransport encryption. libpq will then copy that string, as well as\nfollowing bytes in application memory up to the next zero byte, to its\nerror report. Depending on what the calling application does with the\nerror report, this could result in disclosure of application memory\ncontents. There is also a small probability of a crash due to reading\nbeyond the end of memory. Fix by properly zero-terminating the server\nmessage. ([CVE-2022-41862](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41862))\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n11.19-0+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-11 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of postgresql-11 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/postgresql-11>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
