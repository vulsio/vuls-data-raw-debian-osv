Insufficient validation of data from the X\nserver can cause out of boundary memory and memory corruption in the\nlibxv library.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2:1.0.7-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxv packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
