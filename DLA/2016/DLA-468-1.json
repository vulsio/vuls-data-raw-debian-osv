	"details": "\nTwo security vulnerabilities were discovered in libuser, a library\nthat implements a standardized interface for manipulating and\nadministering user and group accounts, that could lead to a denial of\nservice or privilege escalation by local users.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-3245](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3245)\nIncomplete blacklist vulnerability in the chfn function in libuser\n before 0.56.13-8 and 0.60 before 0.60-7, as used in the userhelper\n program in the usermode package, allows local users to cause a\n denial of service (/etc/passwd corruption) via a newline character\n in the GECOS field.\n* [CVE-2015-3246](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3246)\nlibuser before 0.56.13-8 and 0.60 before 0.60-7, as used in the\n userhelper program in the usermode package, directly modifies\n /etc/passwd, which allows local users to cause a denial of service\n (inconsistent file state) by causing an error during the\n modification. NOTE: this issue can be combined with [CVE-2015-3245](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3245)\n to gain privileges.\n\n\nIn addition the usermode package, which depends on libuser, was\nrebuilt against the updated version.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in\n\n\nlibuser 1:0.56.9.dfsg.1-1.2+deb7u1\nusermode 1.109-1+deb7u2\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libuser and usermode packages.\n\n\n",
