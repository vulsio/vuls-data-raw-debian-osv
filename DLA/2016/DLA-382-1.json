	"summary": "sudo - security update",
	"details": "\nWhen sudo is configured to allow a user to edit files under a\ndirectory that they can already write to without using sudo, they can\nactually edit (read and write) arbitrary files. Daniel Svartman\nreported that a configuration like this might be introduced\nunintentionally if the editable files are specified using wildcards,\nfor example:\n\n\n\n```\n\n    operator ALL=(root) sudoedit /home/*/*/test.txt\n\n```\n\nThe default behaviour of sudo has been changed so that it does not\nallow editing of a file in a directory that the user can write to, or\nthat is reached by following a symlink in a directory that the user\ncan write to. These restrictions can be disabled, but this is\nstrongly discouraged.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this has been fixed in\nversion 1.7.4p4-2.squeeze.6.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy) and the stable distribution\n(jessie), this will be fixed soon.\n\n\n",
