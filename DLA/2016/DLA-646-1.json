This security patch provides\n a comprehensive solution that identifies and removes comments\n prior to checking validity of the statement to ensure no SQLi\n vectors occur.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.11.13-1.1+deb7u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zendframework packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
