	"details": "\nSaulius Lapinskas from Lithuanian State Social Insurance Fund Board\ndiscovered that Squid3, a fully featured web proxy cache, does not\nproperly process responses to If-None-Modified HTTP conditional\nrequests, leading to client-specific Cookie data being leaked to other\nclients. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to discover\nprivate and sensitive information about another client's browsing\nsession.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.1.20-2.2+deb7u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
