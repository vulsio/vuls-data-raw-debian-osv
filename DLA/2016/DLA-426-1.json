	"details": "\nAndreas Schneider reported that libssh2, an SSH2 protocol\nimplementation used by many applications, did not generate\nsufficiently long Diffie-Hellman secrets.\n\n\nThis vulnerability could be exploited by an eavesdropper to decrypt\nand to intercept SSH sessions.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.6-1+deb6u2. Although the changelog refers to sha256,\nthis version only supports DH SHA-1 key exchange and it is that key\nexchange method that has been fixed.\n\n\nFor the oldstable (wheezy) and stable (jessie) distributions, this\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\n",
