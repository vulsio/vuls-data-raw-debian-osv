	"details": "\nAdith Sudhakar discovered a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) issue in\nmonit, a utility for monitoring hosts and services. An attacker could\ncause an authenticated admin to change monitoring for hosts/services\nthrough a forged link. This update fixes the vulnerability by adding\nCSRF protection via a security token and enforced POST requests for\nactions that cause changes to the monitoring.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.4-2+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your monit packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
