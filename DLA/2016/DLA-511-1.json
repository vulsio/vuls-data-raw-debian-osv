	"details": "\nA specially crafted HTTP response from a tracker (or potentially a UPnP\nbroadcast) can crash libtorrent in the parse\\_chunk\\_header() function.\nAlthough this function is not present in this version, upstream's\nadditional sanity checks were added to abort the program if necessary\ninstead of crashing it.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.15.10-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libtorrent-rasterbar packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
