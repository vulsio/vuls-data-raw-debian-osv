As there is no easy fix for this flaw,\nit was decided that PDF support will be removed altogether from mat for\nthe time being.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.3.2-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mat packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
