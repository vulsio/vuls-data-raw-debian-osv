	"details": "\nApache PDFBox did not properly initialize the XML parsers, which\nallows context-dependent attackers to conduct XML External Entity\n(XXE) attacks via a crafted PDF. This may lead to the disclosure of\nconfidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery,\nport scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is\nlocated, and other system impacts.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.7.0+dfsg-4+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpdfbox-java packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
