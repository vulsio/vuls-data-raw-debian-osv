	"details": "\nThe quagga package installs world readable sensitive files in /etc/quagga,\nand might be subject to denial of service because of lacking packet size\nchecks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-4036](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4036)\nThe quagga package before 0.99.23-2.6.1 uses weak permissions for\n /etc/quagga, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information\n by reading files in the directory.\n* [CVE-2016-4049](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4049)\nThe bgp\\_dump\\_routes\\_func function in bgpd/bgp\\_dump.c in Quagga does\n not perform size checks when dumping data, which might allow remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon\n crash) via a large BGP packet.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.99.22.4-1+wheezy3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
