	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a password policy issue in libvirt, a\nlibrary for interfacing with different virtualization systems.\n\n\nSetting an empty graphics password is documented as a way to disable\nVNC/SPICE access, but QEMU does not always behave like that. VNC would\nhappily accept the empty password. We enforce the behavior by setting\npassword expiration to now.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this issue has been fixed in libvirt version\n0.9.12.3-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.\n\n\n",
