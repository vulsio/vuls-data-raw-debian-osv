	"details": "\nThis update fixes certain known vulnerabilities in pound in squeeze-lts by\nbackporting the version in wheezy.\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-3555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555)\nThe TLS protocol, and the SSL protocol 3.0 and possibly earlier, as\n used in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0, mod\\_ssl\n in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.14 and earlier, OpenSSL before 0.9.8l,\n GnuTLS 2.8.5 and earlier, Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS)\n 3.12.4 and earlier, multiple Cisco products, and other products,\n does not properly associate renegotiation handshakes with an\n existing connection, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to\n insert data into HTTPS sessions, and possibly other types of\n sessions protected by TLS or SSL, by sending an unauthenticated\n request that is processed retroactively by a server in a\n post-renegotiation context, related to a plaintext injection\n attack, aka the Project Mogul issue.\n* [CVE-2011-3389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3389)\nThe SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft\n Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google\n Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode\n with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle\n attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise\n chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction\n with JavaScript code that uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API, (2) the\n Java URLConnection API, or (3) the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a\n BEAST attack.\n* [CVE-2012-4929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929)\nThe TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, as used in Mozilla Firefox, Google\n Chrome, Qt, and other products, can encrypt compressed data without\n properly obfuscating the length of the unencrypted data, which\n allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers\n by observing length differences during a series of guesses in which\n a string in an HTTP request potentially matches an unknown string in\n an HTTP header, aka a CRIME attack.\n* [CVE-2014-3566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566)\nThe SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and other\n products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier\n for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a\n padding-oracle attack, aka the POODLE issue.\n\n\n",
