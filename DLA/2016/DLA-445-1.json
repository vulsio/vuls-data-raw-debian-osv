The fix for this CVE\nstrongly relies on exception handling present in more recent versions of\nsquid3, that I failed to identify in the previous update. I have\nreverted the patch to take the safest position, taking into account that\nSqueeze users should migrate to a supported version of Debian. This\npost-EOL update is intended to keep a functional squid3 package in the\narchive.\n\n\n",
