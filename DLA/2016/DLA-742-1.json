	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Chrony, a versatile implementation of the\nNetwork Time Protocol, did not verify peer associations of symmetric\nkeys when authenticating packets, which might allow remote attackers\nto conduct impersonation attacks via an arbitrary trusted key, aka a\n\"skeleton key.\"\n\n\nThis update also resolves Debian bug #568492.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.24-3.1+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your chrony packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
