	"details": "\nDawid Golunski discovered that PHPMailer, a popular library to send\nemail from PHP applications, allowed a remote attacker to execute\ncode if they were able to provide a crafted Sender address.\n\n\nNote that for this issue also [CVE-2016-10045](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10045) was assigned, which is a\nregression in the original patch proposed for [CVE-2016-10033](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10033). Because\nthe origial patch was not applied in Debian, Debian was not vulnerable\nto [CVE-2016-10045](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10045).\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.1-1.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libphp-phpmailer packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
