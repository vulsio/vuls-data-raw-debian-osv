	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in pdns, an authoritative\nDNS server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-5426](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5426) /\n [CVE-2016-5427](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5427)\nFlorian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that the PowerDNS\n Authoritative Server accepts queries with a qname's length larger\n than 255 bytes and does not properly handle dot inside labels. A\n remote, unauthenticated attacker can take advantage of these flaws\n to cause abnormal load on the PowerDNS backend by sending specially\n crafted DNS queries, potentially leading to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2016-6172](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6172)\nIt was reported that a malicious primary DNS server can crash a\n secondary PowerDNS server due to improper restriction of zone size\n limits. This update adds a feature to limit AXFR sizes in response\n to this flaw.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.1-4.1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
