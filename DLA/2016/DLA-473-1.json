	"details": "\nA vulnerability was found in how hostapd and wpa\\_supplicant writes the\nconfiguration file update for the WPA/WPA2 passphrase parameter. If\nthis parameter has been updated to include control characters either\nthrough a WPS operation ([CVE-2016-4476](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4476)) \nor through local configuration\nchange over the wpa\\_supplicant control interface ([CVE-2016-4477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4477)), the\nresulting configuration file may prevent the hostapd and\nwpa\\_supplicant from starting when the updated file is used. In\naddition for wpa\\_supplicant, it may be possible to load a local\nlibrary file and execute code from there with the same privileges\nunder which the wpa\\_supplicant process runs.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-4476](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4476)\nhostapd 0.6.7 through 2.5 and wpa\\_supplicant 0.6.7 through 2.5 do\n not reject \\n and \\r characters in passphrase parameters, which\n allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon\n outage) via a crafted WPS operation.\n* [CVE-2016-4477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4477)\nwpa\\_supplicant 0.4.0 through 2.5 does not reject \\n and \\r\n characters in passphrase parameters, which allows local users to\n trigger arbitrary library loading and consequently gain privileges,\n or cause a denial of service (daemon outage), via a crafted (1)\n SET, (2) SET\\_CRED, or (3) SET\\_NETWORK command.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.0-3+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.\n\n\n",
