	"summary": "nagios3 - security update",
	"details": "\nNagios was found to be vulnerable to two security issues that, when\ncombined, lead to a remote root code execution vulnerability.\nFortunately, the hardened permissions of the Debian package limit the\neffect of those to information disclosure, but privilege escalation to\nroot is still possible locally.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-9565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9565)\nImproper sanitization of RSS feed input enables unauthenticated\n remote read and write of arbitrary files which may lead to remote\n code execution if the web root is writable.\n* [CVE-2016-9566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9566)\nUnsafe logfile handling allows unprivileged users to escalate their\n privileges to root. In wheezy, this is possible only through the\n debug logfile which is disabled by default.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.4.1-3+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nagios3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
