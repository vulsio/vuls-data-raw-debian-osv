	"details": "\nMarcin Icewall Noga of Cisco Talos discovered an out-of-bound read\nvulnerability in the CInArchive::ReadFileItem method in p7zip, a 7zr\nfile archiver with high compression ratio. A remote attacker can take\nadvantage of this flaw to cause a denial-of-service or, potentially the\nexecution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\np7zip, if a specially crafted UDF file is processed.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n9.20.1~dfsg.1-4+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your p7zip packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
