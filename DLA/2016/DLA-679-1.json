It could occur while processing USB command ring\n in xhci\\_ring\\_fetch.\n* [CVE-2016-8577](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8577)\nqemu-kvm built with the virtio-9p back-end support is vulnerable to a memory\n leakage issue. It could occur while doing a I/O read operation in\n v9fs\\_read() routine.\n* [CVE-2016-8578](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8578)\nqemu-kvm built with the virtio-9p back-end support is vulnerable to a null\n pointer dereference issue. It could occur while doing an I/O vector\n unmarshalling operation in v9fs\\_iov\\_vunmarshal() routine.\n* [CVE-2016-8669](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8669)\nqemu-kvm built with the 16550A UART emulation support is vulnerable to a\n divide by zero issue. It could occur while updating serial device parameters\n in serial\\_update\\_parameters.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u17.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
