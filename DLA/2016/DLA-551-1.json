This could be used to direct a\n CSRF attack against a user.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4:3.4.11.1-2+deb7u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
