	"details": "\nThe Network Security Service (NSS) libraries uses\nenvironment variables to configure lots of things, some of which refer to\nfile system locations. Others can be degrade the operation of NSS in various\nways, forcing compatibility modes and so on.\n\n\nPreviously, these environment variables were not ignored SUID\nbinaries. This version of NetScape Portable Runtime Library (NSPR)\nintroduce a new API, PR\\_GetEnVSecure, to address this.\n\n\nBoth NSPR and NSS need to be upgraded to address this problem.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in NSPR version\n4.12-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nspr packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
