	"details": "\nTwo related issues have been discovered in Expat, a C library for\nparsing XML.\n\n\n* [CVE-2012-6702](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6702)\nThis issue was introduced when [CVE-2012-0876](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0876) was addressed. Stefan\n SĂ¸rensen discovered that the use of the function XML\\_Parse() seeds\n the random number generator generating repeated outputs for rand()\n calls.\n* [CVE-2016-5300](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5300)\nThis is the product of an incomplete solution for [CVE-2012-0876](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0876). The\n parser poorly seeds the random number generator allowing an\n attacker to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML\n file with crafted identifiers.\n\n\nYou might need to manually restart programs and services using expat\nlibraries.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.1.0-1+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
