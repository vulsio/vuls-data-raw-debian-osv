This vulnerability affects most\n applications which perform host name resolution using getaddrinfo,\n including system services.\n* The following fixed vulnerabilities currently lack CVE assignment\n\n Andreas Schwab reported a memory leak (memory allocation without a\n matching deallocation) while processing certain DNS answers in\n getaddrinfo, related to the \\_nss\\_dns\\_gethostbyname4\\_r function.\n This vulnerability could lead to a denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in eglibc version\neglibc\\_2.11.3-4+deb6u11. In addition this version corrects the fix for\n[CVE-2014-9761](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9761) \nin Squeeze, which have wrongly marked a few symbols as\npublic instead of private.\n\n\nWhile it is only necessary to ensure that all processes are not using\nthe old eglibc anymore, it is recommended to reboot the machines after\napplying the security upgrade.\n\n\nWe recommend you to upgrade your eglibc packages.\n\n\n",
