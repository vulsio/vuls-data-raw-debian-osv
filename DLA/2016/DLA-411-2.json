To solve this issue, payload parsing has been refactored\n out of strtod into a separate functions that nan\\* can call directly.\n* [CVE-2015-8776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8776)\nThe strftime() function made it possible to access invalid memory,\n allowing to segfault the calling application.\n* [CVE-2015-8778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8778)\nhcreate() was susceptible to an integer overflow, that may results\n in out-of-bounds heap accesses.\n* [CVE-2015-8779](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8779)\nThe catopen() function suffered from multiple unbounded stack\n allocations.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in eglibc version\neglibc\\_2.11.3-4+deb6u9. We recommend you to upgrade your eglibc\npackages.\n\n\n",
