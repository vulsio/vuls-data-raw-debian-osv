This may allow a malicious\n MITM to perform a startTLS stripping attack if the client code\n does not explicitly check the response code for startTLS.\n* [CVE-2016-5636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5636)\nIssue #26171: Fix possible integer overflow and heap corruption\n in zipimporter.get\\_data().\n* [CVE-2016-5699](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5699)\nProtocol injection can occur not only if an application sets a\n header based on user-supplied values, but also if the application\n ever tries to fetch a URL specified by an attacker (SSRF case) OR\n if the application ever accesses any malicious web server\n (redirection case).\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.7.3-6+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
