	"summary": "libxfixes - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a integer overflow in libxfixes, a library\nproviding a client interface to the X11 XFIXES extension.\n\n\nThe 32 bit field rep.length was not checked for validity, which allowed an\ninteger overflow on 32 bit systems. A malicious server could send INT\\_MAX as\nlength which was then multiplied by the size of XRectangle. In this case the\nclient would not read the whole data from server, getting out of sync.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this issue has been fixed in libxfixes version\n1:5.0-4+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxfixes packages.\n\n\n",
