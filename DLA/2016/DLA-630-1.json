If the command string exceeds 1024\ncharacters a buffer overflow will occur.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.3.5+dfsg1-2+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zookeeper packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
