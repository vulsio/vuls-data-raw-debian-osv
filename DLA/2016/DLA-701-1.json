A remote attacker could take advantage of\nthese flaws to cause a denial of service (daemon crash), or potentially\nto execute arbitrary code.\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-7291](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7291)\nIt was discovered that memcached, when running in verbose mode, can\n be crashed by sending carefully crafted requests that trigger an\n unbounded key print, resulting in a daemon crash.\n* [CVE-2016-8704](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8704) /\n [CVE-2016-8705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8705) /\n [CVE-2016-8706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8706)\nAleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos found several vulnerabilities in\n memcached. A remote attacker could cause an integer overflow by\n sending carefully crafted requests to the memcached server,\n resulting in a daemon crash.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.4.13-0.2+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
