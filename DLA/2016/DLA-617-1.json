	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in libarchive,\na multi-format archive and compression library. An attacker could\ntake advantage of these flaws to cause an out of bounds read or a\ndenial of service against an application using the libarchive12\nlibrary using a carefully crafted input file.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-8915](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8915)\nParis Zoumpouloglou of Project Zero labs discovered a flaw in\n libarchive bsdtar. Using a crafted file bsdtar can perform an\n out-of-bounds memory read which will lead to a SEGFAULT.\n* [CVE-2016-7166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7166)\nAlexander Cherepanov discovered a flaw in libarchive compression\n handling. Using a crafted gzip file, one can get libarchive to\n invoke an infinite chain of gzip compressors until all the memory\n has been exhausted or another resource limit kicks in.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.0.4-3+wheezy3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libarchive packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
