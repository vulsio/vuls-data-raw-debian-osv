	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in GNU Guile, an\nimplementation of the Scheme programming language. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-8605](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8605)\nThe mkdir procedure of GNU Guile temporarily changed the process'\n umask to zero. During that time window, in a multithreaded\n application, other threads could end up creating files with\n insecure permissions.\n* [CVE-2016-8606](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8606)\nGNU Guile provides a REPL server which is a command prompt that\n developers can connect to for live coding and debugging purposes.\n The REPL server is started by the '--listen' command-line option\n or equivalent API.\n\n\nIt was reported that the REPL server is vulnerable to the HTTP\n inter-protocol attack.\n\n\nThis constitutes a remote code execution vulnerability for\n developers running a REPL server that listens on a loopback device\n or private network. Applications that do not run a REPL server, as\n is usually the case, are unaffected.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.0.5+1-3+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your guile-2.0 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
