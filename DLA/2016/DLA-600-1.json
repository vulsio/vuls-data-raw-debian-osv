	"details": "\nThe crypto library libgcrypt11 has a weakness in the random number\ngenerator.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-6313](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6313)\nFelix DĂśrre and Vladimir Klebanov from the Karlsruhe Institute of\n Technology found a bug in the mixing functions of Libgcrypt's random\n number generator. An attacker who obtains 4640 bits from the RNG can\n trivially predict the next 160 bits of output.\n\n\nA first analysis on the impact of this bug in GnuPG shows that existing\nRSA keys are not weakened. For DSA and Elgamal keys it is also unlikely\nthat the private key can be predicted from other public information.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.5.0-5+deb7u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libgcrypt11 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
