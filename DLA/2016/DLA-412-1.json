On an SMP system this could possibly lead to\n a crash, information leak or privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been\nfixed in version 2.6.32-48squeeze19. Additionally, this version\nincludes upstream stable update 2.6.32.70. This is the final update\nto the linux-2.6 package for squeeze.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed\nsoon.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), [CVE-2015-7566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7566), [CVE-2015-8767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8767) and\n[CVE-2016-0723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0723) were fixed in linux version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u3 and\nthe remaining problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\n",
