	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SPIP, a website\nengine for publishing written in PHP.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-7980](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7980)\nNicolas Chatelain of Sysdream Labs discovered a cross-site request\n forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the valider\\_xml action of SPIP. This\n allows remote attackers to make use of potential additional\n vulnerabilities such as the one described in [CVE-2016-7998](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7998).\n* [CVE-2016-7981](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7981)\nNicolas Chatelain of Sysdream Labs discovered a reflected cross-site\n scripting attack (XSS) vulnerability in the validater\\_xml action of\n SPIP. An attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability to\n inject arbitrary code by tricking an administrator to open a\n malicious link.\n* [CVE-2016-7982](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7982)\nNicolas Chatelain of Sysdream Labs discovered a file enumeration /\n path traversal attack in the validator\\_xml action of SPIP. An\n attacker could use this to enumerate files in an arbitrary directory\n on the file system.\n* [CVE-2016-7998](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7998)\nNicolas Chatelain of Sysdream Labs discovered a possible PHP code\n execution vulnerability in the template compiler/composer function\n of SPIP. In combination with the XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities\n described in this advisory, a remote attacker could take advantage\n of this to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.\n* [CVE-2016-7999](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7999)\nNicolas Chatelain of Sysdream Labs discovered a server side request\n forgery in the valider\\_xml action of SPIP. Attackers could take\n advantage of this vulnerability to send HTTP or FTP requests to\n remote servers that they don't have direct access to, possibly\n bypassing access controls such as a firewall.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.1.17-1+deb7u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your spip packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
