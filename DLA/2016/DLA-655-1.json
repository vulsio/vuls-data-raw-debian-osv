	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in mpg123, an\nMPEG layer 1/2/3 audio decoder and player. An attacker could take\nadvantage of these flaws to cause a denial of service against mpg123\nor applications using the libmpg123 library with a carefully crafted\ninput file.\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-9497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9497)\nMyautsai PAN discovered a flaw in the decoder initialization code\n of libmpg123. A specially crafted mp3 input file can be used to\n cause a buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2016-1000247](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1000247)\nJerold Hoong discovered a flaw in the id3 tag processing code of\n libmpg123. A specially crafted mp3 input file could be used to\n cause a buffer over-read, resulting in a denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.14.4-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mpg123 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
