Additional information can be found at\n [\\\n https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/06/27/undefined-pointer-arithmetic/](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/06/27/undefined-pointer-arithmetic/)\n* [CVE-2016-2178](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2178)\nCesar Pereida, Billy Brumley and Yuval Yarom discovered a timing\n leak in the DSA code.\n* [CVE-2016-2179](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2179) /\n [CVE-2016-2181](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2181)\nQuan Luo and the OCAP audit team discovered denial of service\n vulnerabilities in DTLS.\n* [CVE-2016-2180](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2180) /\n [CVE-2016-2182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2182) /\n [CVE-2016-6303](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6303)\nShi Lei discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in\n TS\\_OBJ\\_print\\_bio() and an out-of-bounds write in BN\\_bn2dec()\n and MDC2\\_Update().\n* [CVE-2016-2183](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2183)\nDES-based cipher suites are demoted from the HIGH group to MEDIUM\n as a mitigation for the SWEET32 attack.\n* [CVE-2016-6302](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6302)\nShi Lei discovered that the use of SHA512 in TLS session tickets\n is susceptible to denial of service.\n* [CVE-2016-6304](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6304)\nShi Lei discovered that excessively large OCSP status request may\n result in denial of service via memory exhaustion.\n* [CVE-2016-6306](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6306)\nShi Lei discovered that missing message length validation when parsing\n certificates may potentially result in denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.0.1t-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl and libssl1.0.0 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
