Please see the MySQL 5.5 Release Notes for further details:\n\n\n* \n* <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-52.html>\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.5.52-0+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.5 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
