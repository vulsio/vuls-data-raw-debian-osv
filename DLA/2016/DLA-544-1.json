	"summary": "tcpreplay - security update",
	"details": "\nThe tcprewrite program, part of the tcpreplay suite, does not check the\nsize of the frames it processes. Huge frames may trigger a segmentation\nfault, and such frames occur when caputuring packets on interfaces with\nan MTU of or close to 65536. For example, the loopback interface lo of\nthe Linux kernel has such a value.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.4.3-2+wheezy2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tcpreplay packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
