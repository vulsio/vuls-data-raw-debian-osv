An attacker\ncould take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial-of-service\nagainst an application using the libtiff4 or libtiffxx0c2 library\n(application crash), or potentially execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running the application.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.9.6-11+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tiff3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
