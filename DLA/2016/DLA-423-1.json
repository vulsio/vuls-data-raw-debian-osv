Information leakage may be possible\n for an attacker with permission to modify the database.\n* [CVE-2015-8631](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8631)\nIt was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind\n to leak memory by supplying a null principal name in a request which\n uses one. Repeating these requests will eventually cause kadmind to\n exhaust all available memory.\n\n\n",
