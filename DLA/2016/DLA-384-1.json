	"details": "\nIt was discovered that InspIRCd did not validate the names in DNS\nresponses before using them in inter-server communication. A remote\nattacker controlling the reverse DNS server for an IRC client could\nuse this for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation on\nthe IRC network.\n\n\nInspIRCd appears to have been completely unusable since version\n1.1.22+dfsg-4+squeeze1 due to a bug in its build system triggered by\n(e)glibc versions newer than 2.9. This has also been fixed.\n\n\n",
