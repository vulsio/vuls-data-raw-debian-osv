	"details": "\nRoundcube, a webmail solution for IMAP servers, was susceptible to\ncross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when handling SVG images.\nWhen right-clicking on the download link of an attached image, it was\npossible that embedded Javascript could be executed in a separate Tab.\n\n\nThe update disables displaying of SVG images in e-mails and TABS.\nDownloading attachments is still possible. This security update also\nmitigates against other ways to exploit this issue in SVG images.\n([CVE-2016-4068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4068))\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.7.2-9+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
