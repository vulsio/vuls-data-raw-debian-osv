	"details": "\nThis update fixes the CVEs described below.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-8812](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8812)\nA flaw was found in the iw\\_cxgb3 Infiniband driver. Whenever it\n could not send a packet because the network was congested, it\n would free the packet buffer but later attempt to send the packet\n again. This use-after-free could result in a denial of service\n (crash or hang), data loss or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-0774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0774)\nIt was found that the fix for [CVE-2015-1805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1805) in kernel versions\n older than Linux 3.16 did not correctly handle the case of a\n partially failed atomic read. A local, unprivileged user could\n use this flaw to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user\n space.\n* [CVE-2016-2384](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2384)\nAndrey Konovalov found that a USB MIDI device with an invalid USB\n descriptor could trigger a double-free. This may be used by a\n physically present user for privilege escalation.\n\n\nAdditionally, it fixes some old security issues with no CVE ID:\n\n\nSeveral kernel APIs permitted reading or writing 2 GiB of data or\n more in a single chunk, which could lead to an integer overflow\n when applied to certain filesystems, socket or device types. The\n full security impact has not been evaluated.\n\n\nFinally, it fixes a regression in 2.6.32-48squeeze17 that would cause\nSamba to hang in some situations.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been\nfixed in version 2.6.32-48squeeze20. This is \\*really\\* the final\nupdate to the linux-2.6 package for squeeze.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), the kernel was not affected\nby the integer overflow issues and the remaining problems will be\nfixed in version 3.2.73-2+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), the kernel was not affected by\nthe integer overflow issues or [CVE-2016-0774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0774), and the remaining\nproblems will be fixed in version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u4.\n\n\n",
