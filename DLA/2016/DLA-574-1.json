	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in qemu-kvm, a full\nvirtualization solution on x86 hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-5239](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5239)\nLian Yihan discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain payload\n messages in the VNC display driver. A malicious guest could use this\n issue to cause the QEMU process to hang, resulting in a denial of\n service.\n* [CVE-2016-2857](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2857)\nLing Liu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled IP checksum\n routines. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause\n QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly leak\n host memory bytes.\n* [CVE-2016-4020](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4020)\nDonghai Zdh discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Task\n Priority Register(TPR). A privileged attacker inside the guest could\n use this issue to possibly leak host memory bytes.\n* [CVE-2016-4439](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4439) /\n [CVE-2016-6351](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6351)\nLi Qiang disovered that the emulation of the 53C9X Fast SCSI\n Controller is affected by out of bound access issues.\n* [CVE-2016-5403](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5403)\nZhenhao Hong discovered that a malicious guest administrator can\n cause unbounded memory allocation in QEMU (which can cause an\n Out-of-Memory condition) by submitting virtio requests without\n bothering to wait for completion.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u14.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
