	"details": "\nA denial of service vulnerability was identified in Commons FileUpload\nthat occurred when the length of the multipart boundary was just below\nthe size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file.\nThis caused the file upload process to take several orders of\nmagnitude longer than if the boundary was the typical tens of bytes long.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.2.2-1+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libcommons-fileupload-java packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
