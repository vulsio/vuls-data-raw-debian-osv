	"details": "\n* [CVE-2016-4658](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4658)\nNamespace nodes must be copied to avoid use-after-free errors.\n But they don't necessarily have a physical representation in a\n document, so simply disallow them in XPointer ranges.\n* [CVE-2016-5131](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5131)\nThe old code would invoke the broken xmlXPtrRangeToFunction.\n range-to isn't really a function but a special kind of\n location step. Remove this function and always handle range-to\n in the XPath code.\n The old xmlXPtrRangeToFunction could also be abused to trigger\n a use-after-free error with the potential for remote code\n execution.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
