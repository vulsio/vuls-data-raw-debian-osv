This complements\n the fix for [CVE-2013-4458](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4458).\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.13-38+deb7u11.\n\n\nWe recommend you to upgrade your eglibc packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system, and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
