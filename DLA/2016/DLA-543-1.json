	"summary": "sqlite3 - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that sqlite3, a C library that implements a SQL\ndatabase engine, would reject a temporary directory (e.g., as specified\nby the TMPDIR environment variable) to which the executing user did not\nhave read permissions. This could result in information leakage as less\nsecure global temporary directories (e.g., /var/tmp or /tmp) would be\nused instead.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.7.13-1+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sqlite3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
