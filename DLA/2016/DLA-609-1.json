	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nThis update fixes the CVEs described below.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-3857](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3857)\nChiachih Wu reported two bugs in the ARM OABI compatibility layer\n that can be used by local users for privilege escalation. The\n OABI compatibility layer is enabled in all kernel flavours for\n armel and armhf.\n* [CVE-2016-4470](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4470)\nWade Mealing of the Red Hat Product Security Team reported that\n in some error cases the KEYS subsystem will dereference an\n uninitialised pointer. A local user can use the keyctl()\n system call for denial of service (crash) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-5696](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5696)\nYue Cao, Zhiyun Qian, Zhongjie Wang, Tuan Dao, and Srikanth V.\n Krishnamurthy of the University of California, Riverside; and Lisa\n M. Marvel of the United States Army Research Laboratory discovered\n that Linux's implementation of the TCP Challenge ACK feature\n results in a side channel that can be used to find TCP connections\n between specific IP addresses, and to inject messages into those\n connections.\n\n\nWhere a service is made available through TCP, this may allow\n remote attackers to impersonate another connected user to the\n server or to impersonate the server to another connected user. In\n case the service uses a protocol with message authentication\n (e.g. TLS or SSH), this vulnerability only allows denial of\n service (connection failure). An attack takes tens of seconds, so\n short-lived TCP connections are also unlikely to be vulnerable.\n\n\nThis may be mitigated by increasing the rate limit for TCP\n Challenge ACKs so that it is never exceeded:\n sysctl net.ipv4.tcp\\_challenge\\_ack\\_limit=1000000000\n* [CVE-2016-5829](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5829)\nSeveral heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in\n the hiddev driver, allowing a local user with access to a HID\n device to cause a denial of service or potentially escalate their\n privileges.\n* [CVE-2016-6136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6136)\nPengfei Wang discovered that the audit subsystem has a\n 'double-fetch' or TOCTTOU bug in its handling of special\n characters in the name of an executable. Where audit logging of\n execve() is enabled, this allows a local user to generate\n misleading log messages.\n* [CVE-2016-6480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6480)\nPengfei Wang discovered that the aacraid driver for Adaptec RAID\n controllers has a 'double-fetch' or TOCTTOU bug in its\n validation of FIB messages passed through the ioctl() system\n call. This has no practical security impact in current Debian\n releases.\n* [CVE-2016-6828](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6828)\nMarco Grassi reported a 'use-after-free' bug in the TCP\n implementation, which can be triggered by local users. The\n security impact is unclear, but might include denial of service or\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-7118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7118)\nMarcin Szewczyk reported that calling fcntl() on a file descriptor\n for a directory on an aufs filesystem would result in am oops.\n This allows local users to cause a denial of service. This is a\n Debian-specific regression introduced in version 3.2.81-1.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.2.81-2. This version also fixes a build failure (bug #827561) for\ncustom kernels with CONFIG\\_MODULES disabled, a regression in version\n3.2.81-1. It also updates the PREEMPT\\_RT featureset to version\n3.2.81-rt117.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, [CVE-2016-3857](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3857) has no impact; [CVE-2016-4470](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4470) and\n[CVE-2016-5829](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5829) were fixed in linux version 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u3 or\nearlier; and the remaining issues are fixed in version 3.16.36-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
