	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-7092](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7092) (XSA-185)\n\n Jeremie Boutoille of Quarkslab and Shangcong Luan of Alibaba\n discovered a flaw in the handling of L3 pagetable entries, allowing\n a malicious 32-bit PV guest administrator can escalate their\n privilege to that of the host.\n* [CVE-2016-7094](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7094) (XSA-187)\n\n x86 HVM guests running with shadow paging use a subset of the x86\n emulator to handle the guest writing to its own pagetables. Andrew\n Cooper of Citrix discovered that there are situations a guest can\n provoke which result in exceeding the space allocated for internal\n state. A malicious HVM guest administrator can cause Xen to fail a\n bug check, causing a denial of service to the host.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.1.6.lts1-2. For Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.4.1-9+deb8u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
