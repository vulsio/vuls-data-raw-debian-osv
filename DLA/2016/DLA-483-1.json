	"summary": "expat - security update",
	"details": "\nGustavo Grieco discovered that Expat, a XML parsing C library, does not\nproperly handle certain kinds of malformed input documents, resulting in\nbuffer overflows during processing and error reporting. A remote\nattacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause an application using\nthe Expat library to crash, or potentially, to execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the user running the application.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.1.0-1+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
