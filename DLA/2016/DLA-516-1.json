	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nThis update fixes the CVEs described below.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-0821](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0821)\nSolar Designer noted that the list poisoning feature, intended\n to mitigate the effects of bugs in list manipulation in the\n kernel, used poison values within the range of virtual addresses\n that can be allocated by user processes.\n* [CVE-2016-1583](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1583)\nJann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that the eCryptfs\n filesystem could be used together with the proc filesystem to\n cause a kernel stack overflow. If the ecryptfs-utils package was\n installed, local users could exploit this, via the\n mount.ecryptfs\\_private program, for denial of service (crash) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-2184](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2184) /\n [CVE-2016-2185](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2185) /\n [CVE-2016-2186](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2186) /\n [CVE-2016-2187](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2187) /\n [CVE-2016-3136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3136) /\n [CVE-2016-3137](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3137) /\n [CVE-2016-3138](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3138) /\n [CVE-2016-3140](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3140)\nRalf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that various USB\n drivers do not sufficiently validate USB descriptors. This\n allowed a physically present user with a specially designed USB\n device to cause a denial of service (crash). Not all the drivers\n have yet been fixed.\n* [CVE-2016-3134](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3134)\nThe Google Project Zero team found that the netfilter subsystem\n does not sufficiently validate filter table entries. A user with\n the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability could use this for denial of service\n (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-3157](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3157) / XSA-171\n\n Andy Lutomirski discovered that the x86\\_64 (amd64) task switching\n implementation did not correctly update the I/O permission level\n when running as a Xen paravirtual (PV) guest. In some\n configurations this would allow local users to cause a denial of\n service (crash) or to escalate their privileges within the guest.\n* [CVE-2016-3672](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3672)\nHector Marco and Ismael Ripoll noted that it was still possible to\n disable Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) for x86\\_32\n (i386) programs by removing the stack resource limit. This made\n it easier for local users to exploit security flaws in programs\n that have the setuid or setgid flag set.\n* [CVE-2016-3951](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3951)\nIt was discovered that the cdc\\_ncm driver would free memory\n prematurely if certain errors occurred during its initialisation.\n This allowed a physically present user with a specially designed\n USB device to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to\n escalate their privileges.\n* [CVE-2016-3955](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3955)\nIgnat Korchagin reported that the usbip subsystem did not check\n the length of data received for a USB buffer. This allowed denial\n of service (crash) or privilege escalation on a system configured\n as a usbip client, by the usbip server or by an attacker able to\n impersonate it over the network. A system configured as a usbip\n server might be similarly vulnerable to physically present users.\n* [CVE-2016-3961](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3961) / XSA-174\n\n Vitaly Kuznetsov of Red Hat discovered that Linux allowed use of\n hugetlbfs on x86 (i386 and amd64) systems even when running as a\n Xen paravirtualised (PV) guest, although Xen does not support huge\n pages. This allowed users with access to /dev/hugepages to cause\n a denial of service (crash) in the guest.\n* [CVE-2016-4482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4482) /\n [CVE-2016-4485](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4485) /\n [CVE-2016-4486](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4486) /\n [CVE-2016-4569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4569) /\n [CVE-2016-4578](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4578) /\n [CVE-2016-4580](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4580) /\n [CVE-2016-5243](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5243) /\n [CVE-2016-5244](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5244)\nKangjie Lu reported that the USB devio, llc, rtnetlink, ALSA\n timer, x25, tipc, and rds facilities leaked information from the\n kernel stack.\n* [CVE-2016-4565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4565)\nJann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that various components\n in the InfiniBand stack implemented unusual semantics for the\n write() operation. On a system with InfiniBand drivers loaded,\n local users could use this for denial of service or privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-4913](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4913)\nAl Viro found that the ISO9660 filesystem implementation did not\n correctly count the length of certain invalid name entries.\n Reading a directory containing such name entries would leak\n information from kernel memory. Users permitted to mount disks or\n disk images could use this to obtain sensitive information.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.2.81-1.\n\n\nThis update also fixes bug #627782, which caused data corruption in\nsome applications running on an aufs filesystem, and includes many\nother bug fixes from upstream stable updates 3.2.79, 3.2.80 and\n3.2.81.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
