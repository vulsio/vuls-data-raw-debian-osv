	"summary": "xerces-c - security update",
	"details": "\nBrandon Perry discovered that xerces-c, a validating XML parser library\nfor C++, fails to successfully parse a DTD that is deeply nested,\ncausing a stack overflow. A remote unauthenticated attacker can take\nadvantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service against applications\nusing the xerces-c library.\n\n\nAdditionally this update includes an enhancement to enable applications\nto fully disable DTD processing through the use of an environment\nvariable (XERCES\\_DISABLE\\_DTD).\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.1.1-3+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xerces-c packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
