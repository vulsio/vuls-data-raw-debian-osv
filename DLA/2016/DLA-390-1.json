The issue is fixed in version\n1.8.46+squeeze.1. Access rights to existing database backups (not only\nfor PostgreSQL) will be limited to the owner of the backup during the\nupgrade of dbconfig-common to this version. Future upgrades will not\nchange access rights in case the local administrator has specific\nrequirements.\n\n\ndbconfig-common is a Debian helper package that is used by a number of\npackages to manage the corresponding database.\n\n\n",
