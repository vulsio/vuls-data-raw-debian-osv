A remote attacker can take\nadvantage of these flaws to cause a denial-of-service against an\napplication using DBD::mysql (application crash), or potentially to\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the\napplication.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.021-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-mysql-perl packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
