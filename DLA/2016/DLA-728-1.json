	"summary": "tomcat6 - security update",
	"details": "\nMultiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat\nservlet and JSP engine, which may result in possible timing attacks to\ndetermine valid user names, bypass of the SecurityManager, disclosure of\nsystem properties, unrestricted access to global resources, arbitrary\nfile overwrites, and potentially escalation of privileges.\n\n\nIn addition this update further hardens Tomcat's init and maintainer\nscripts to prevent possible privilege escalations. Thanks to Paul\nSzabo for the report.\n\n\nThis is probably the last security update of Tomcat 6 which will reach\nits end-of-life exactly in one month. We strongly recommend to switch\nto another supported version such as Tomcat 7 at your earliest\nconvenience.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n6.0.45+dfsg-1~deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat6 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
