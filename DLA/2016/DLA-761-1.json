	"details": "\nIt was discovered that bottle, a WSGI-framework for the Python\nprogramming language, did not properly filter \"\\r\\n\" sequences when\nhandling redirections. This allowed an attacker to perform CRLF\nattacks such as HTTP header injection.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.10.11-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-bottle packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
