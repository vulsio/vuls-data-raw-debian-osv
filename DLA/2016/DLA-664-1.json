	"details": "\nTobias Stoeckmann from the OpenBSD project has discovered a number of\nissues in the way various X client libraries handle the responses they\nreceive from servers. Insufficient validation of data from the X server\ncould cause out of boundary memory writes in the libXrender library\npotentially allowing the user to escalate their privileges.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:0.9.7-1+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxrender packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
