	"details": "\nDawid Golunski from legalhackers.com discovered that Debian's version\nof Tomcat 7 was vulnerable to a local privilege escalation. Local\nattackers who have gained access to the server in the context of the\ntomcat7 user through a vulnerability in a web application were able to\nreplace the file with a symlink to an arbitrary file.\n\n\nThe full advisory can be found at\n\n\n\nIn addition this security update also fixes Debian bug #821391. File\nownership in /etc/tomcat7 will no longer be unconditionally overridden\non upgrade. As another precaution the file permissions of Debian\nspecific configuration files in /etc/tomcat7 were changed to 640 to\ndisallow world readable access.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.0.28-4+deb7u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
