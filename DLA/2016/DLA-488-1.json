	"details": "\nMarkus Krell discovered that Xymon (formerly known as Hobbit), a\nnetwork- and applications-monitoring system, was vulnerable to the\nfollowing security issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-2054](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2054)\nThe incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the config\n command can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in\n denial of service (via application crash) or remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2016-2055](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2055)\nThe incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the config\n command can lead to an information leak by serving sensitive\n configuration files to a remote user.\n* [CVE-2016-2056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2056)\nThe commands handling password management do not properly validate\n user-supplied input, and are thus vulnerable to shell command\n injection by a remote user.\n* [CVE-2016-2058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2058)\nIncorrect escaping of user-supplied input in status webpages can\n be used to trigger reflected cross-site scripting attacks.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.3.0~beta2.dfsg-9.1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xymon packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
