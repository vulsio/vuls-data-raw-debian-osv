In some cases,\nwhen asked to allocate a huge quantity of memory, instead of failing the\nrequest, it will return a pointer to a small amount of memory possibly\ntricking the application into a buffer overwrite.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:7.1-9.1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libgc packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
