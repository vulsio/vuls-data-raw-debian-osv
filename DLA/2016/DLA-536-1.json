	"summary": "wget - security update",
	"details": "\nOn a server redirect from HTTP to a FTP resource, wget would trust\nthe HTTP server and uses the name in the redirected URL as the\ndestination filename.\nThis behaviour was changed and now it works similarly as a redirect\nfrom HTTP to another HTTP resource so the original name is used as\nthe destination file. To keep the previous behaviour the user must\nprovide --trust-server-names.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.13.4-3+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wget packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
