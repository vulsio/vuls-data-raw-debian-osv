	],
	"summary": "apache2 - security update",
	"details": "\nScott Geary of VendHQ discovered that the Apache HTTPD server used the\nvalue of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the\nHTTP\\_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was\nincorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the\nproxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an\nattacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.2.22-13+deb7u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
