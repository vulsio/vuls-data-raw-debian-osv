This could lead to a heap corruption.\n* [CVE-2016-2106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2106)\nGuido Vranken discovered that an overflow can occur in the function\n EVP\\_EncryptUpdate() if an attacker can supply a large amount of data.\n This could lead to a heap corruption.\n* [CVE-2016-2107](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2107)\nJuraj Somorovsky discovered a padding oracle in the AES CBC cipher\n implementation based on the AES-NI instruction set. This could allow\n an attacker to decrypt TLS traffic encrypted with one of the cipher\n suites based on AES CBC.\n* [CVE-2016-2108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2108)\nDavid Benjamin from Google discovered that two separate bugs in the\n ASN.1 encoder, related to handling of negative zero integer values\n and large universal tags, could lead to an out-of-bounds write.\n* [CVE-2016-2109](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2109)\nBrian Carpenter discovered that when ASN.1 data is read from a BIO\n using functions such as d2i\\_CMS\\_bio(), a short invalid encoding can\n casuse allocation of large amounts of memory potentially consuming\n excessive resources or exhausting memory.\n* [CVE-2016-2176](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2176)\nGuido Vranken discovered that ASN.1 Strings that are over 1024 bytes\n can cause an overread in applications using the X509\\_NAME\\_oneline()\n function on EBCDIC systems. This could result in arbitrary stack data\n being returned in the buffer.\n\n\nAdditional information about these issues can be found in the OpenSSL\nsecurity advisory at <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt>\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these issues have been fixed in openssl version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u21\n\n\n",
