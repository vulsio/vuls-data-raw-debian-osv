	"details": "\n\"DrWhax\" of the Tails project reported that Claws Mail is missing\nrange checks in some text conversion functions. A remote attacker\ncould exploit this to run arbitrary code under the account of a user\nthat receives a message from them using Claws Mail.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-8614](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8614)\nThere were no checks on the output length for conversions between\n JIS (ISO-2022-JP) and EUC-JP, between JIS and UTF-8, and from\n Shift\\_JIS to EUC-JP.\n* [CVE-2015-8708](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8708)\nThe original fix for [CVE-2015-8614](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8614) was incomplete.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been\nfixed in version 3.7.6-4+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy) and the stable distribution\n(jessie), this will be fixed soon. These versions were built with\nhardening features that make this issue harder to exploit.\n\n\n",
