If a user were tricked into opening a specially-crafted\nimage, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause Eye of GNOME to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.4.2-1+build1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your eog packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
