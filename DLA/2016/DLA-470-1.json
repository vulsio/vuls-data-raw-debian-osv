	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a possible read access beyond a buffer\nvulnerability in libksba, a X.509 and CMS certificate support library.\n\n\nThe returned length of the object from \\_ksba\\_ber\\_parse\\_tl (ti.length)\nwas not always checked against the actual buffer length, thus leading\nto a read access after the end of the buffer and thus a SEGV.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this issue has been fixed in libksba version\n1.2.0-2+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libksba packages.\n\n\n",
