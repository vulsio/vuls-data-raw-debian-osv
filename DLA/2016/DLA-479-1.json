	"summary": "xen - security update",
	"details": "\nThis security update fixes a number of security issues in Xen in wheezy.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.1.6.1-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libidn packages.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-2752](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2752)\nThe XEN\\_DOMCTL\\_memory\\_mapping hypercall in Xen 3.2.x through 4.5.x,\n when using a PCI passthrough device, is not preemptable, which\n allows local x86 HVM domain users to cause a denial of service (host\n CPU consumption) via a crafted request to the device model\n (qemu-dm).\n* [CVE-2015-2756](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2756)\nQEMU, as used in Xen 3.3.x through 4.5.x, does not properly restrict\n access to PCI command registers, which might allow local HVM guest\n users to cause a denial of service (non-maskable interrupt and host\n crash) by disabling the (1) memory or (2) I/O decoding for a PCI\n Express device and then accessing the device, which triggers an\n Unsupported Request (UR) response.\n* [CVE-2015-5165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5165)\nThe C+ mode offload emulation in the RTL8139 network card device\n model in QEMU, as used in Xen 4.5.x and earlier, allows remote\n attackers to read process heap memory via unspecified vectors.\n* [CVE-2015-5307](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5307)\nThe KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.2.6, and Xen 4.3.x\n through 4.6.x, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service\n (host OS panic or hang) by triggering many #AC (aka Alignment Check)\n exceptions, related to svm.c and vmx.c.\n* [CVE-2015-7969](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7969)\nMultiple memory leaks in Xen 4.0 through 4.6.x allow local guest\n administrators or domains with certain permission to cause a denial\n of service (memory consumption) via a large number of teardowns of\n domains with the vcpu pointer array allocated using the (1)\n XEN\\_DOMCTL\\_max\\_vcpus hypercall or the xenoprofile state vcpu pointer\n array allocated using the (2) XENOPROF\\_get\\_buffer or (3)\n XENOPROF\\_set\\_passive hypercall.\n* [CVE-2015-7970](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7970)\nThe p2m\\_pod\\_emergency\\_sweep function in arch/x86/mm/p2m-pod.c in Xen\n 3.4.x, 3.5.x, and 3.6.x is not preemptible, which allows local x86\n HVM guest administrators to cause a denial of service (CPU\n consumption and possibly reboot) via crafted memory contents that\n triggers a \"time-consuming linear scan,\" related to\n Populate-on-Demand.\n* [CVE-2015-7971](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7971)\nXen 3.2.x through 4.6.x does not limit the number of printk console\n messages when logging certain pmu and profiling hypercalls, which\n allows local guests to cause a denial of service via a sequence of\n crafted (1) HYPERCALL\\_xenoprof\\_op hypercalls, which are not properly\n handled in the do\\_xenoprof\\_op function in common/xenoprof.c, or (2)\n HYPERVISOR\\_xenpmu\\_op hypercalls, which are not properly handled in\n the do\\_xenpmu\\_op function in arch/x86/cpu/vpmu.c.\n* [CVE-2015-7972](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7972)\nThe (1) libxl\\_set\\_memory\\_target function in tools/libxl/libxl.c and\n (2) libxl\\_\\_build\\_post function in tools/libxl/libxl\\_dom.c in Xen\n 3.4.x through 4.6.x do not properly calculate the balloon size when\n using the populate-on-demand (PoD) system, which allows local HVM\n guest users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) via\n unspecified vectors related to \"heavy memory pressure.\"\n* [CVE-2015-8104](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8104)\nThe KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.2.6, and Xen 4.3.x\n through 4.6.x, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service\n (host OS panic or hang) by triggering many #DB (aka Debug)\n exceptions, related to svm.c.\n* [CVE-2015-8339](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8339)\nThe memory\\_exchange function in common/memory.c in Xen 3.2.x through\n 4.6.x does not properly hand back pages to a domain, which might\n allow guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (host\n crash) via unspecified vectors related to domain teardown.\n* [CVE-2015-8340](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8340)\nThe memory\\_exchange function in common/memory.c in Xen 3.2.x through\n 4.6.x does not properly release locks, which might allow guest OS\n administrators to cause a denial of service (deadlock or host crash)\n via unspecified vectors, related to XENMEM\\_exchange error handling.\n* [CVE-2015-8550](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8550)\nXen, when used on a system providing PV backends, allows local guest\n OS administrators to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or\n gain privileges by writing to memory shared between the frontend and\n backend, aka a double fetch vulnerability.\n* [CVE-2015-8554](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8554)\nBuffer overflow in hw/pt-msi.c in Xen 4.6.x and earlier, when using\n the qemu-xen-traditional (aka qemu-dm) device model, allows local\n x86 HVM guest administrators to gain privileges by leveraging a\n system with access to a passed-through MSI-X capable physical PCI\n device and MSI-X table entries, related to a \"write path.\"\n* [CVE-2015-8555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8555)\nXen 4.6.x, 4.5.x, 4.4.x, 4.3.x, and earlier do not initialize x86\n FPU stack and XMM registers when XSAVE/XRSTOR are not used to manage\n guest extended register state, which allows local guest domains to\n obtain sensitive information from other domains via unspecified\n vectors.\n* [CVE-2015-8615](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8615)\nThe hvm\\_set\\_callback\\_via function in arch/x86/hvm/irq.c in Xen 4.6\n does not limit the number of printk console messages when logging\n the new callback method, which allows local HVM guest OS users to\n cause a denial of service via a large number of changes to the\n callback method (HVM\\_PARAM\\_CALLBACK\\_IRQ).\n* [CVE-2016-1570](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1570)\nThe PV superpage functionality in arch/x86/mm.c in Xen 3.4.0, 3.4.1,\n and 4.1.x through 4.6.x allows local PV guests to obtain sensitive\n information, cause a denial of service, gain privileges, or have\n unspecified other impact via a crafted page identifier (MFN) to the\n (1) MMUEXT\\_MARK\\_SUPER or (2) MMUEXT\\_UNMARK\\_SUPER sub-op in the\n HYPERVISOR\\_mmuext\\_op hypercall or (3) unknown vectors related to\n page table updates.\n* [CVE-2016-1571](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1571)\nThe paging\\_invlpg function in include/asm-x86/paging.h in Xen 3.3.x\n through 4.6.x, when using shadow mode paging or nested\n virtualization is enabled, allows local HVM guest users to cause a\n denial of service (host crash) via a non-canonical guest address in\n an INVVPID instruction, which triggers a hypervisor bug check.\n* [CVE-2016-2270](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2270)\nXen 4.6.x and earlier allows local guest administrators to cause a\n denial of service (host reboot) via vectors related to multiple\n mappings of MMIO pages with different cachability settings.\n* [CVE-2016-2271](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2271)\nVMX in Xen 4.6.x and earlier, when using an Intel or Cyrix CPU,\n allows local HVM guest users to cause a denial of service (guest\n crash) via vectors related to a non-canonical RIP.\n\n\n",
