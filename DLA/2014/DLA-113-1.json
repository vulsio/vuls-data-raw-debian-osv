	"summary": "bsd-mailx - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that bsd-mailx, an implementation of the mail\ncommand, had an undocumented feature which treats syntactically valid\nemail addresses as shell commands to execute.\n\n\nUsers who need this feature can re-enable it using the expandaddr in\nan appropriate mailrc file. This update also removes the obsolete -T\noption. An older security vulnerability, [CVE-2004-2771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2771), had already\nbeen addressed in the Debian's bsd-mailx package.\n\n\nNote that this security update does not remove all mailx facilities\nfor command execution, though. Scripts which send mail to addresses\nobtained from an untrusted source (such as a web form) should use the\n\"--\" separator before the email addresses (which was fixed to work\nproperly in this update), or they should be changed to invoke\n\"mail -t\" or \"sendmail -i -t\" instead, passing the recipient addresses\nas part of the mail header.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 8.1.2-0.20100314cvs-1+deb6u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bsd-mailx packages.\n\n\n",
