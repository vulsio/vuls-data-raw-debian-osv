	"summary": "apt - security update",
	"details": "\nThis update fixes a regression introduced in 0.8.10.3+squeeze5 where\napt would send invalid HTTP requests when sending If-Range queries.\n\n\nFor reference, the original advisory text follows.\n\n\nThe Google Security Team discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in\nthe HTTP transport code in apt-get. An attacker able to\nman-in-the-middle a HTTP request to an apt repository can trigger the\nbuffer overflow, leading to a crash of the http apt method binary, or\npotentially to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nThe following regression fixes were included in this update:\n\n\n* Fix regression from the previous update in [DLA-53-1](dla-53)\n when the custom apt configuration option for Dir::state::lists is set to a\n relative path (#762160).\n* Fix regression in the reverificaiton handling of cdrom: sources that\n may lead to incorrect hashsum warnings. Affected users need to run\n \"apt-cdrom add\" again after the update was applied.\n* Fix regression from the previous update in [DLA-53-1](dla-53)\n when file:/// sources are used and those are on a different partition than\n the apt state directory.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in apt version 0.8.10.3+squeeze6\n\n\n",
