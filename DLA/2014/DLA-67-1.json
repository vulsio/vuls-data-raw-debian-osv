A remote attacker could still\n cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a specially-crafted\n input file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk\n regular expression rule.\n* [CVE-2014-3587](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3587)\nIt was discovered that the CDF parser of the fileinfo module does\n not properly process malformed files in the Composite Document File\n (CDF) format, leading to crashes.\n* [CVE-2014-3597](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3597)\nIt was discovered that the original fix for [CVE-2014-4049](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4049) did not\n completely address the issue. A malicious server or\n man-in-the-middle attacker could cause a denial of service (crash)\n and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS TXT record.\n* [CVE-2014-4670](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4670)\nIt was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain SPL\n Iterators. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause PHP to\n crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in php5 version 5.3.3-7+squeeze22\n\n\n",
