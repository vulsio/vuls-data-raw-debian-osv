If you need\n to re-enable it for some reason, you can set the environment\n variable OPENSSL\\_NO\\_DEFAULT\\_ZLIB.\n\n\nIt's important that you upgrade the libssl0.9.8 package and not\njust the openssl package.\n\n\nAll applications linked to openssl need to be restarted. You can\nuse the tool checkrestart from the package debian-goodies to\ndetect affected programs or reboot your system.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in openssl version 0.9.8o-4squeeze16\n\n\n",
