	"details": "\nTwo bugs were discovered in clamav and are fixed by this release.\n\n\nOne issue is in clamscan, the command line anti-virus scanner included\nin the package, which could lead to crashes when scanning certain files\n([CVE-2013-6497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6497)).\nThe second issue is in libclamav which caused a heap buffer overflow\nwhen scanning a specially crafted y0da Crypter obfuscated PE file\n([CVE-2014-9050](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9050)). Note that this is remotely exploitable when ClamAV is\nused as a mail gateway scanner.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in clamav version 0.98.1+dfsg-1+deb6u4\n\n\nIf you use clamav, we highly recommend that you upgrade to this version.\n\n\n",
