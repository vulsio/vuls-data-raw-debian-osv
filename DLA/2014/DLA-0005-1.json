This only affects use cases where\nsource packages are downloaded via this command; it does not\naffect regular Debian package installation and upgrading.\n([CVE-2014-0478](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0478))\n\n\nIt was discovered that APT incorrectly handled the Verify-Host\nconfiguration option. If a remote attacker were able to perform a\nman-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to steal\nrepository credentials. This only relevant for systems that use APT\nsources on https connections (requires the apt-transport-https package\nto be installed). ([CVE-2011-3634](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3634))\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in apt version 0.8.10.3+squeeze2\n\n\n",
