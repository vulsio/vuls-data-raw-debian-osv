	"details": "\nTimothy D. Morgan discovered that run-mailcap, an utility to execute\nprograms via entries in the mailcap file, is prone to shell command\ninjection via shell meta-characters in filenames. In specific scenarios\nthis flaw could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.48-1+deb6u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mime-support packages.\n\n\n",
