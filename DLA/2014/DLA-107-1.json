	"details": "\nFlorian Maury from ANSSI discovered that unbound, a validating,\nrecursive, and caching DNS resolver, was prone to a denial of service\nvulnerability. An attacker crafting a malicious zone and able to emit\n(or make emit) queries to the server can trick the resolver into\nfollowing an endless series of delegations, leading to resource\nexhaustion and huge network usage.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in unbound version 1.4.6-1+squeeze4\n\n\n",
