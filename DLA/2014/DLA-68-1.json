Some characters are forbidden in the GET parameter due\n to filtering of the URL, but this can be circumvented by using\n a POST parameter.\n Nevertheless, this issue is exploitable via the GET parameter\n alone, with some user interaction.\n* [[CVE-2014-3877](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3877)]\n The parameter addto is reflected only slightly filtered back to\n the user as part of the HTML page. Some characters are forbidden\n in the GET parameter due to filtering of the URL, but this can\n be circumvented by using a POST parameter. Nevertheless, this\n issue is exploitable via the GET parameter alone, with some user\n interaction.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in fex version 20100208+debian1-1+squeeze4\n\n\n",
