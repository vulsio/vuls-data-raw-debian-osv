Then each plugin runs in its own\n UID plugin state directory, owned by that UID. (Closes: #684075),\n (Closes: #679897), closes [CVE-2012-3512](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3512).\n* plugins: use runtime $ENV{MUNIN\\_PLUGSTATE}. So all properly written\n plugins will use /var/lib/munin-node/plugin-state/$uid/$some\\_file now please report plugins that are still using /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/ as those might pose a security risk!\n* Don't abort data collection for a node due to malicious node, fixing\n munin#1397, [CVE-2013-6048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6048).\n* Validate multigraph plugin name, [CVE-2013-6359](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6359).\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in munin version 1.4.5-3+deb6u1\n\n\n",
