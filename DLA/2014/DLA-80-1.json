A remote attacker\ncould provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by an\napplication using libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption\n(denial of service) based on excessive entity substitutions, even if\nentity substitution was disabled, which is the parser default behavior.\n([CVE-2014-3660](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3660))\n\n\nIn addition, this update addresses a misapplied chunk for a patch\nreleased the previous version (#762864).\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in libxml2 version 2.7.8.dfsg-2+squeeze10\n\n\n",
