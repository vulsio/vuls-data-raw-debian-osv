	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in getmail4, a mail retriever\nwith support for POP3, IMAP4 and SDPS, that could allow man-in-the-middle\nattacks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-7273](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7273)\nThe IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.0.0 through 4.43.0 does\n not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows\n man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain sensitive\n information via a crafted certificate.\n* [CVE-2014-7274](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7274)\nThe IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.44.0 does not verify\n that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common\n Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows\n man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain sensitive\n information via a crafted certificate from a recognized Certification\n Authority.\n* [CVE-2014-7275](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7275)\nThe POP3-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.0.0 through 4.44.0 does\n not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows\n man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof POP3 servers and obtain sensitive\n information via a crafted certificate.\n\n\nFor the squeeze distribution, those problems have been fixed by importing\na new upstream version: 4.46.0-1~deb6u1. The updated package has been\nprepared by Osamu Aoki.\n\n\n",
