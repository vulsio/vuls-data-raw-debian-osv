Also, as an amendment, as a side effect of the changes\ndone back then, the MIME type detection of some files had\nimproved from \"application/octet-stream\" to something more specific\nlike \"application/x-dosexec\" or \"application/x-iso9660-image\".\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in file version 5.04-5+squeeze7\n\n\n",
