You can\nuse the tool checkrestart from the package debian-goodies to\ndetect affected programs or reboot your system.\n\n\nIt's important that you upgrade the libssl0.9.8 package and not\njust the openssl package.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in openssl version 0.9.8o-4squeeze15\n\n\n",
