	"details": "\nTwo issues have been found in curl, a command line tool and an easy-to-use\nclient-side library for transferring data with URL syntax.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-22946](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22946)\nCrafted answers from a server might force clients to not use TLS on\n connections though TLS was required and expected.\n* [CVE-2021-22947](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22947)\nWhen using STARTTLS to initiate a TLS connection, the server might\n send multiple answers before the TLS upgrade and such the client\n would handle them as being trusted. This could be used by a\n MITM-attacker to inject fake response data.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.52.1-5+deb9u16.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of curl please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
