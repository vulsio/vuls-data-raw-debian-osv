	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities were found in Apache Log4j2, a Logging\nFramework for Java, which could lead to a denial of service or information\ndisclosure.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-9488](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9488)\nImproper validation of certificate with host mismatch in Apache Log4j SMTP\n appender. This could allow an SMTPS connection to be intercepted by a\n man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log messages sent through\n that appender.\n* [CVE-2021-45105](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45105)\nApache Log4j2 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from\n self-referential lookups. This allows an attacker with control over Thread\n Context Map data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is\n interpreted.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.12.3-0+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache-log4j2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache-log4j2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache-log4j2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
