	"details": "\ngolang-go.crypto was recently updated with a fix for [CVE-2019-11840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11840). This in\nturn requires all packages that use the affected code to be recompiled in order\nto pick up the security fix.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-11840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11840)\nAn issue was discovered in supplementary Go cryptography libraries, aka\n golang-googlecode-go-crypto. If more than 256 GiB of keystream is\n generated, or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits, the amd64\n implementation will first generate incorrect output, and then cycle back to\n previously generated keystream. Repeated keystream bytes can lead to loss of\n confidentiality in encryption applications, or to predictability in CSPRNG\n applications.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.21-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your snapd packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of snapd please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/snapd>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
