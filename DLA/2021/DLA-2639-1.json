	"details": "\nIt was discovered that OpenDMARC, a milter implementation of DMARC,\nhas improper null termination in the function opendmarc\\_xml\\_parse that\ncan result in a one-byte heap overflow in opendmarc\\_xml when parsing a\nspecially crafted DMARC aggregate report. This can cause remote memory\ncorruption when a '\\0' byte overwrites the heap metadata of the next\nchunk and its PREV\\_INUSE flag.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.3.2-2+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your opendmarc packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of opendmarc please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/opendmarc>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
