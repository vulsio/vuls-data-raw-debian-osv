	"summary": "linux-4.19 - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-3702](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-3702)\nA flaw was found in the driver for Atheros IEEE 802.11n family of\n chipsets (ath9k) allowing information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2020-16119](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-16119)\nHadar Manor reported a use-after-free in the DCCP protocol\n implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker can take\n advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially\n to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2021-3444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3444)\n, [CVE-2021-3600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3600)\n\n\nTwo flaws were discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF) verifier. A\n local user could exploit these to read and write arbitrary memory\n in the kernel, which could be used for privilege escalation.\n\n\nThis can be mitigated by setting sysctl\n kernel.unprivileged\\_bpf\\_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by\n unprivileged users.\n* [CVE-2021-3612](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3612)\nMurray McAllister reported a flaw in the joystick input subsystem.\n A local user permitted to access a joystick device could exploit\n this to read and write out-of-bounds in the kernel, which could\n be used for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-3653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3653)\nMaxim Levitsky discovered a vulnerability in the KVM hypervisor\n implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel: Missing\n validation of the `int\\_ctl` VMCB field could allow a malicious L1\n guest to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt\n Controller) for the L2 guest. The L2 guest can take advantage of\n this flaw to write to a limited but still relatively large subset\n of the host physical memory.\n* [CVE-2021-3655](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3655)\nIlja Van Sprundel and Marcelo Ricardo Leitner found multiple flaws\n in the SCTP implementation, where missing validation could lead to\n an out-of-bounds read. On a system using SCTP, a networked\n attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2021-3656](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3656)\nMaxim Levitsky and Paolo Bonzini discovered a flaw in the KVM\n hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux\n kernel. Missing validation of the `virt\\_ext` VMCB field could\n allow a malicious L1 guest to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE\n intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. Under\n these circumstances, the L2 guest is able to run VMLOAD/VMSAVE\n unintercepted and thus read/write portions of the host's physical\n memory.\n* [CVE-2021-3679](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3679)\nA flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could\n allow a privileged local user (with CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN capability) to\n cause a denial of service (resource starvation).\n* [CVE-2021-3732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3732)\nAlois Wohlschlager reported a flaw in the implementation of the\n overlayfs subsystem, allowing a local attacker with privileges to\n mount a filesystem to reveal files hidden in the original mount.\n* [CVE-2021-3743](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3743)\nAn out-of-bounds memory read was discovered in the Qualcomm IPC\n router protocol implementation, allowing to cause a denial of\n service or information leak.\n* [CVE-2021-3753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3753)\nMinh Yuan reported a race condition in the vt\\_k\\_ioctl in\n drivers/tty/vt/vt\\_ioctl.c, which may cause an out of bounds read\n in vt.\n* [CVE-2021-22543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22543)\nDavid Stevens discovered a flaw in how the KVM hypervisor maps\n host memory into a guest. A local user permitted to access\n /dev/kvm could use this to cause certain pages to be freed when\n they should not, leading to a use-after-free. This could be used\n to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-33624](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33624)\n, [CVE-2021-34556](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-34556), [CVE-2021-35477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-35477)\n\n\nMultiple researchers discovered flaws in the Extended BPF (eBPF)\n verifier's protections against information leaks through\n speculation execution. A local user could exploit these to read\n sensitive information.\n\n\nThis can be mitigated by setting sysctl\n kernel.unprivileged\\_bpf\\_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by\n unprivileged users.\n* [CVE-2021-35039](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-35039)\nA flaw was discovered in module signature enforcement. A custom\n kernel with IMA enabled might have allowed loading unsigned kernel\n modules when it should not have.\n* [CVE-2021-37159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-37159)\nA flaw was discovered in the hso driver for Option mobile\n broadband modems. An error during initialisation could lead to a\n double-free or use-after-free. An attacker able to plug in USB\n devices could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2021-38160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38160)\nA flaw in the virtio\\_console was discovered allowing data\n corruption or data loss by an untrusted device.\n* [CVE-2021-38198](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38198)\nA flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for x86\n processors, that could result in virtual memory protection within\n a guest not being applied correctly. When shadow page tables are\n used - i.e. for nested virtualisation, or on CPUs lacking the EPT\n or NPT feature - a user of the guest OS might be able to exploit\n this for denial of service or privilege escalation within the\n guest.\n* [CVE-2021-38199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38199)\nMichael Wakabayashi reported a flaw in the NFSv4 client\n implementation, where incorrect connection setup ordering allows\n operations of a remote NFSv4 server to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2021-38205](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38205)\nAn information leak was discovered in the xilinx\\_emaclite network\n driver. On a custom kernel where this driver is enabled and used,\n this might make it easier to exploit other kernel bugs.\n* [CVE-2021-40490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-40490)\nA race condition was discovered in the ext4 subsystem when writing\n to an inline\\_data file while its xattrs are changing. This could\n result in denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.19.208-1~deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-4.19>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
