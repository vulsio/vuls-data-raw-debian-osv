	"details": "\nThis update reverts the Symantec CA blacklist (which was originally\n#911289). The following root certificates were added back (+):\n + GeoTrust Global CA\n + GeoTrust Primary Certification Authority\n + \"GeoTrust Primary Certification Authority - G2\"\n + \"GeoTrust Primary Certification Authority - G3\"\n + GeoTrust Universal CA\n + thawte Primary Root CA\n + \"thawte Primary Root CA - G2\"\n + \"thawte Primary Root CA - G3\"\n + \"VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G4\"\n + \"VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5\"\n + VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority\n**Note**: due to bug #743339, CA certificates added back in this version\nwon't automatically be trusted again on upgrade.
