	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in pillow (Python Imaging\nLibrary - PIL).\n\n\nAffected binary packages:\n\n\npython-imaging\n python-pil-dbg\n python-pil-doc\n python-pil.imagetk-dbg\n python-pil.imagetk\n python-pil\n python3-pil-dbg\n python3-pil.imagetk-dbg\n python3-pil.imagetk\n python3-pil\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-35653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-35653)\nPillow through 8.2.0 and PIL (aka Python Imaging Library) through\n 1.1.7 allow an attacker to pass controlled parameters directly into\n a convert function to trigger a buffer overflow in Convert.c.\n* [CVE-2021-25290](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-25290)\nAn issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.1.1. In TiffDecode.c,\n there is a negative-offset memcpy with an invalid size.\n* [CVE-2021-28676](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28676)\nAn issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For FLI data,\n FliDecode did not properly check that the block advance was\n non-zero, potentially leading to an infinite loop on load.\n* [CVE-2021-28677](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28677)\nAn issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For EPS data, the\n readline implementation used in EPSImageFile has to deal with any\n combination of \\r and \\n as line endings. It used an accidentally\n quadratic method of accumulating lines while looking for a line\n ending. A malicious EPS file could use this to perform a DoS of\n Pillow in the open phase, before an image was accepted for opening.\n* [CVE-2021-34552](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-34552)\nPillow through 8.2.0 and PIL (aka Python Imaging Library) through\n 1.1.7 allow an attacker to pass controlled parameters directly into\n a convert function to trigger a buffer overflow in Convert.c.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.0.0-4+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pillow packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of pillow please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pillow>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
