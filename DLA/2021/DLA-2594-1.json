	"details": "\nThree security issues have been detected in tomcat8.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-24122](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-24122)\nWhen serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system,\n Apache Tomcat versions 8.5.0 to 8.5.59 is susceptible to JSP source code\n disclosure in some configurations. The root cause was the unexpected\n behaviour of the JRE API File.getCanonicalPath() which in turn was caused\n by the inconsistent behaviour of the Windows API (FindFirstFileW) in some\n circumstances.\n* [CVE-2021-25122](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-25122)\nWhen responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat could\n duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one\n request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results\n of user A's request.\n* [CVE-2021-25329](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-25329)\nThe fix for 2020-9484 was incomplete. When using Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to\n 8.5.61 with a configuration edge case that was highly unlikely to be used,\n the Tomcat instance was still vulnerable to [CVE-2020-9494](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9494). Note that both\n the previously published prerequisites for [CVE-2020-9484](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9484) and the\n previously published mitigations for [CVE-2020-9484](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9484) also apply to this\n issue.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n8.5.54-0+deb9u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of tomcat8 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tomcat8>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
