An integer overflow can occur while walking through tiles\nthat could be exploited to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code. In order\nto trigger this vulnerability, a victim would need to open a specially crafted\nXCF file.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.0.7-6+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xcftools packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of xcftools please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xcftools>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
