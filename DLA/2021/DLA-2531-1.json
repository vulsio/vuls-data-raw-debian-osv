	"summary": "python-bottle - security update",
	"details": "\nThe package src:python-bottle before 0.12.19 are vulnerable to\nWeb Cache Poisoning by using a vector called parameter cloaking.\n\n\nWhen the attacker can separate query parameters using a\nsemicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation\nof the request between the proxy (running with default configuration)\nand the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached\nas completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the\nsemicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a\ncache key of an unkeyed parameter.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.12.13-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-bottle packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python-bottle please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-bottle>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
