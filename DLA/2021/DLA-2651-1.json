	"summary": "python-django - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was potential directory-traversal vulnerability\nin Django, a popular Python-based web development framework.\n\n\nThe MultiPartParser, UploadedFile and FieldFile classes allowed\ndirectory-traversal via uploaded files with suitably crafted file names. In\norder to mitigate this risk, stricter basename and path sanitation is now\napplied. Specifically, empty file names and paths with dot segments are\nrejected.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-31542](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31542)\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.10.7-2+deb9u13.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
