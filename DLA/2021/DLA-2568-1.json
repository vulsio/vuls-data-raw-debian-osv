	"summary": "bind9 - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a buffer overflow attack in the bind9 DNS\nserver caused by an issue in the GSSAPI (\"Generic Security Services\") security\npolicy negotiation.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-8625](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8625)\nBIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and\n are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses\n BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a\n server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for\n the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options.\n Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is\n frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as\n in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active\n Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome of a successful\n exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However,\n remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects:\n BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1\n -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview\n Edition. Also release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17\n development branch\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.3+deb9u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
