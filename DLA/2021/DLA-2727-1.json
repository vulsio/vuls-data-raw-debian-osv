This is due to a lack of sanitization in\n xdg/Menu.py before an eval call.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.25-4+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pyxdg packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
