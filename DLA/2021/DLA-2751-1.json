A\n maliciously crafted renegotiation request could result in a server crash\n (see OpenSSL issue [CVE-2021-3449](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3449)). Disable the feature altogether on\n OpenSSL versions that permit doing so, which are 1.1.0h and newer.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n9.6.23-0+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.6 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of postgresql-9.6 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/postgresql-9.6>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
