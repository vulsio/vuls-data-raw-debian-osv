	"summary": "mediawiki - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in mediawiki, a wiki\nwebsite engine for collaborative work.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-20270](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20270)\nAn infinite loop in SMLLexer in Pygments used by mediawiki as\n one if its lexers may lead to denial of service when performing\n syntax highlighting of a Standard ML (SML) source file, as\n demonstrated by input that only contains the exception keyword.\n* [CVE-2021-27291](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27291)\npygments, the lexers used by mediawiki rely heavily on regular\n expressions. Some of the regular expressions have exponential or\n cubic worst-case complexity and are vulnerable to ReDoS. By\n crafting malicious input, an attacker can cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2021-30152](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-30152)\nAn issue was discovered in MediaWiki. When using the MediaWiki\n API to protect a page, a user is currently able to protect to a\n higher level than they currently have permissions for.\n* [CVE-2021-30155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-30155)\nAn issue was discovered in MediaWiki before. ContentModelChange\n does not check if a user has correct permissions to create and set\n the content model of a nonexistent page.\n* [CVE-2021-30158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-30158)\nAn issue was discovered in MediaWiki. Blocked users are unable to\n use Special:ResetTokens. This has security relevance because a\n blocked user might have accidentally shared a token, or might know\n that a token has been compromised, and yet is not able to block\n any potential future use of the token by an unauthorized party.\n* [CVE-2021-30159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-30159)\nAn issue was discovered in MediaWiki. Users can bypass intended\n restrictions on deleting pages in certain fast double move\n situations. MovePage::isValidMoveTarget() uses FOR UPDATE, but\n it's only called if Title::getArticleID() returns non-zero with no\n special flags. Next, MovePage::moveToInternal() will delete the\n page if getArticleID(READ\\_LATEST) is non-zero. Therefore, if the\n page is missing in the replica DB, isValidMove() will return true,\n and then moveToInternal() will unconditionally delete the page if\n it can be found in the master.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.27.7-1~deb9u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of mediawiki please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/mediawiki>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
