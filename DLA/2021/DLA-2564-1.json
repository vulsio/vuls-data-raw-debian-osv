	"details": "\nAlex Birnberg discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in\nthe Horde Application Framework, more precisely its Text Filter API.\nAn attacker could take control of a user's mailbox by sending a\ncrafted e-mail.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-26929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26929)\nAn XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition\n (where the Horde\\_Text\\_Filter library is used). The attacker can\n send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a\n link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php,\n because bespoke use of \\x00\\x00\\x00 and \\x01\\x01\\x01 interferes\n with XSS defenses.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.3.5-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php-horde-text-filter packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of php-horde-text-filter please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/php-horde-text-filter>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
