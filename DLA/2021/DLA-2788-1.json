	"summary": "strongswan - security update",
	"details": "\nResearchers at the United States of America National Security Agency (NSA)\nidentified a denial of services vulnerability in strongSwan, an\nIKE/IPsec suite.\n\n\nOnce the in-memory certificate cache is full it tries to randomly replace\nlesser used entries. Depending on the generated random value, this could\nlead to an integer overflow that results in a double-dereference and a\ncall using out-of-bounds memory that most likely leads to a segmentation\nfault.\n\n\nRemote code execution can't be ruled out completely, but attackers have\nno control over the dereferenced memory, so it seems unlikely at this\npoint.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n5.5.1-4+deb9u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of strongswan please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
