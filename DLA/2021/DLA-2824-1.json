	"summary": "firebird3.0 - security update",
	"details": "\nAn authenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary code in\nFirebird, a relational database based on InterBase 6.0, by executing a\nmalformed SQL statement. The only known solution is to disable\nexternal UDF libraries from being loaded. In order to achieve this,\nthe default configuration has changed to UdfAccess=None. This will\nprevent the fbudf module from being loaded, but may also break other\nfunctionality relying on modules.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.0.1.32609.ds4-14+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your firebird3.0 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of firebird3.0 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/firebird3.0>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
