	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential directory traversal issue in\nDjango, a Python-based web development framework.\n\n\nThe vulnerability could have been exploited by maliciously crafted\nfilenames. However, the upload handlers built into Django itself were not\naffected.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-28658](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28658)\nIn Django 2.2 before 2.2.20, 3.0 before 3.0.14, and 3.1 before 3.1.8,\n MultiPartParser allowed directory traversal via uploaded files with\n suitably crafted file names. Built-in upload handlers were not affected by\n this vulnerability.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.10.7-2+deb9u12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
