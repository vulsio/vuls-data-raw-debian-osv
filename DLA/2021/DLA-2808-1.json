	"details": "\nThere were a couple of vulnerabilites found in src:python3.5, the\nPython interpreter v3.5, and are as follows:\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-3733](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3733)\nThe ReDoS-vulnerable regex has quadratic worst-case complexity\n and it allows cause a denial of service when identifying\n crafted invalid RFCs. This ReDoS issue is on the client side\n and needs remote attackers to control the HTTP server.\n* [CVE-2021-3737](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3737)\nHTTP client can get stuck infinitely reading len(line) < 64k\n lines after receiving a 100 Continue HTTP response. This\n could lead to the client being a bandwidth sink for anyone\n in control of a server.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.5.3-1+deb9u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python3.5 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python3.5 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python3.5>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
