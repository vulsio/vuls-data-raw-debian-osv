This is now enabled by default.\n* [CVE-2019-0222](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0222)\nUnmarshalling corrupt MQTT frame can lead to broker Out of Memory\n exception making it unresponsive\n* [CVE-2021-26117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26117)\nThe optional ActiveMQ LDAP login module can be configured to use\n anonymous access to the LDAP server. The anonymous context is used\n to verify a valid users password in error, resulting in no check\n on the password.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.14.3-3+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your activemq packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of activemq please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/activemq>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
