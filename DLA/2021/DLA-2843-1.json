A local attacker can take\n advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially\n to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2021-0920](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-0920)\nA race condition was discovered in the local sockets (AF\\_UNIX)\n subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user\n could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or\n crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-3612](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3612)\nMurray McAllister reported a flaw in the joystick input subsystem.\n A local user permitted to access a joystick device could exploit\n this to read and write out-of-bounds in the kernel, which could\n be used for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-3653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3653)\nMaxim Levitsky discovered a vulnerability in the KVM hypervisor\n implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel: Missing\n validation of the `int\\_ctl` VMCB field could allow a malicious L1\n guest to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt\n Controller) for the L2 guest. The L2 guest can take advantage of\n this flaw to write to a limited but still relatively large subset\n of the host physical memory.\n* [CVE-2021-3655](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3655)\nIlja Van Sprundel and Marcelo Ricardo Leitner found multiple flaws\n in the SCTP implementation, where missing validation could lead to\n an out-of-bounds read. On a system using SCTP, a networked\n attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2021-3679](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3679)\nA flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could\n allow a privileged local user (with CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN capability) to\n cause a denial of service (resource starvation).\n* [CVE-2021-3732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3732)\nAlois Wohlschlager reported a flaw in the implementation of the\n overlayfs subsystem, allowing a local attacker with privileges to\n mount a filesystem to reveal files hidden in the original mount.\n* [CVE-2021-3753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3753)\nMinh Yuan reported a race condition in the vt\\_k\\_ioctl in\n drivers/tty/vt/vt\\_ioctl.c, which may cause an out of bounds read\n in vt.\n* [CVE-2021-3760](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3760)\nLin Horse reported a flaw in the NCI (NFC Controller Interface)\n driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.\n\n\nHowever, this driver is not included in the binary packages\n provided by Debian.\n* [CVE-2021-20317](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20317)\nIt was discovered that the timer queue structure could become\n corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up. A local\n user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial\n of service (system hang).\n* [CVE-2021-20321](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20321)\nA race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem\n driver. A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its\n underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-20322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20322)\nAn information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation. A\n remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP\n ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a\n DNS poisoning attack against that system.\n* [CVE-2021-22543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22543)\nDavid Stevens discovered a flaw in how the KVM hypervisor maps\n host memory into a guest. A local user permitted to access\n /dev/kvm could use this to cause certain pages to be freed when\n they should not, leading to a use-after-free. This could be used\n to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-37159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-37159)\nA flaw was discovered in the hso driver for Option mobile\n broadband modems. An error during initialisation could lead to a\n double-free or use-after-free. An attacker able to plug in USB\n devices could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2021-38160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38160)\nA flaw in the virtio\\_console was discovered allowing data\n corruption or data loss by an untrusted device.\n* [CVE-2021-38198](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38198)\nA flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for x86\n processors, that could result in virtual memory protection within\n a guest not being applied correctly. When shadow page tables are\n used - i.e. for nested virtualisation, or on CPUs lacking the EPT\n or NPT feature - a user of the guest OS might be able to exploit\n this for denial of service or privilege escalation within the\n guest.\n* [CVE-2021-38199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38199)\nMichael Wakabayashi reported a flaw in the NFSv4 client\n implementation, where incorrect connection setup ordering allows\n operations of a remote NFSv4 server to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2021-38204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38204)\nA flaw was discovered in the max4321-hcd USB host controller\n driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.\n\n\nHowever, this driver is not included in the binary packages\n provided by Debian.\n* [CVE-2021-38205](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38205)\nAn information leak was discovered in the xilinx\\_emaclite network\n driver. On a custom kernel where this driver is enabled and used,\n this might make it easier to exploit other kernel bugs.\n* [CVE-2021-40490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-40490)\nA race condition was discovered in the ext4 subsystem when writing\n to an inline\\_data file while its xattrs are changing. This could\n result in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2021-41864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41864)\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)\n subsystem. A local user could exploit this for denial of service\n (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n\n\nThis can be mitigated by setting sysctl\n kernel.unprivileged\\_bpf\\_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by\n unprivileged users.\n* [CVE-2021-42008](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-42008)\nA heap buffer overflow was discovered in the 6pack serial port\n network driver. A local user with CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability could\n exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash), or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-42739](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-42739)\nA heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for\n FireWire-connected DVB receivers. A local user with access to a\n firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory\n corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-43389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43389)\nThe Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP\n subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an\n out-of-bounds read and object type confusion. A local user with\n CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could\n exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),\n or possibly for privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.9.290-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
