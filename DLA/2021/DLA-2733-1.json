	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat\nservlet and JSP engine.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-30640](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-30640)\nA vulnerability in the JNDI Realm of Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to\n authenticate using variations of a valid user name and/or to bypass some of\n the protection provided by the LockOut Realm.\n* [CVE-2021-33037](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33037)\nApache Tomcat did not correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding request\n header in some circumstances leading to the possibility to request\n smuggling when used with a reverse proxy. Specifically: - Tomcat\n incorrectly ignored the transfer encoding header if the client declared it\n would only accept an HTTP/1.0 response; - Tomcat honoured the identify\n encoding; and - Tomcat did not ensure that, if present, the chunked\n encoding was the final encoding.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n8.5.54-0+deb9u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of tomcat8 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tomcat8>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
