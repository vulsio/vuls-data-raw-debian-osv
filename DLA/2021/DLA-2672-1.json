	"details": "\nMultiple security issues have been discovered in imagemagick.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-27751](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27751)\nA flaw was found in MagickCore/quantum-export.c. An attacker who submits a\n crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior\n in the form of values outside the range of type\n `unsigned long long` as well as a shift exponent that is too large for\n 64-bit type. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,\n but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.\n* [CVE-2021-20243](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20243)\nA flaw was found in MagickCore/resize.c. An attacker who submits a crafted\n file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior\n in the form of math division by zero.\n* [CVE-2021-20245](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20245)\nA flaw was found in coders/webp.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that\n is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of\n math division by zero.\n* [CVE-2021-20309](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20309)\nA division by zero in WaveImage() of MagickCore/visual-effects.c may trigger\n undefined behavior via a crafted image file submitted to an application using\n ImageMagick.\n* [CVE-2021-20312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20312)\nAn integer overflow in WriteTHUMBNAILImage of coders/thumbnail.c may trigger\n undefined behavior via a crafted image file that is submitted by an attacker\n and processed by an application using ImageMagick.\n* [CVE-2021-20313](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20313)\nA potential cipher leak when the calculate signatures in TransformSignature is possible.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u13.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of imagemagick please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/imagemagick>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
