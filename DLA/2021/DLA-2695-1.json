Depending on\nhow klibc is used, these could lead to the execution of arbitrary\ncode, privilege escalation, or denial of service.\n\n\nThanks to Microsoft Vulnerability Research for reporting the heap bugs\nand going some of the way to identifying the cpio bugs.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-31870](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31870)\nMultiplication in the calloc() function may result in an integer\n overflow and a subsequent heap buffer overflow.\n* [CVE-2021-31871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31871)\nAn integer overflow in the cpio command may result in a NULL\n pointer dereference.\n* [CVE-2021-31872](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31872)\nMultiple possible integer overflows in the cpio command on 32-bit\n systems may result in a buffer overflow or other security impact.\n* [CVE-2021-31873](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31873)\nAdditions in malloc() function may result in integer overflow and\n subsequent heap buffer overflow.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.0.4-9+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your klibc packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of klibc please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/klibc>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
