	"summary": "coturn - security update",
	"details": "\nA flaw was discovered in coturn, a TURN and STUN server for VoIP. By\ndefault coturn does not allow peers on the loopback addresses\n(127.x.x.x and ::1). A remote attacker can bypass the protection via a\nspecially crafted request using a peer address of 0.0.0.0 and trick\ncoturn in relaying to the loopback interface. If listening on IPv6 the\nloopback interface can also be reached by using either [::1] or [::] as\nthe address.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n4.5.0.5-1+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your coturn packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of coturn please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/coturn>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
