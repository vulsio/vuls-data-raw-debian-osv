	"details": "\nSeveral security problems have been fixed in the cron daemon.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-9525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9525)\nFix group crontab to root escalation via postinst.\n* [CVE-2019-9704](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9704)\nA very large crontab created by a user could crash the daemon.\n* [CVE-2019-9705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9705)\nEnforce maximum crontab line count of 10000 to prevent a malicious\n user from creating an excessivly large crontab.\n* [CVE-2019-9706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9706)\nFix for possible DoS by use-after-free.\n* Additionally, a bypass of /etc/cron.{allow,deny} on failure to open has \nbeen fixed. If these files exist, then they must be readable by the user\nexecuting crontab(1). Users will now be denied by default if they aren't.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.0pl1-128+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cron packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of cron please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cron>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
