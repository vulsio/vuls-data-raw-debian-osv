	"details": "\nA couple of vulnerabilites were found in python-gnupg, a Python\nwrapper for the GNU Privacy Guard.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-12020](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12020)\nMarcus Brinkmann discovered that GnuPG before 2.2.8 improperly\n handled certain command line parameters. A remote attacker\n could use this to spoof the output of GnuPG and cause unsigned\n e-mail to appear signed.\n* [CVE-2019-6690](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6690)\nIt was discovered that python-gnupg incorrectly handled the GPG\n passphrase. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted\n passphrase that would allow them to control the output of\n encryption and decryption operations.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.3.9-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-gnupg packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python-gnupg please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-gnupg>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
