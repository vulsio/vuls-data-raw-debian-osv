	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a remote authentication credential leak in\nthe \"lynx\" text-based web browser.\n\n\nThe package now correctly handles authentication subcomponents in URIs (eg.\nhttps://user:pass@example.com) to avoid remote attackers discovering\ncleartext credentials in SSL connection data.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-38165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38165)\n Lynx through 2.8.9 mishandles the userinfo subcomponent of a URI, which\n allows remote attackers to discover cleartext credentials because they may\n appear in SNI data.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.8.9dev11-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lynx packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
