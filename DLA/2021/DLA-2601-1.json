	"details": "\ncloud-init has the ability to generate and set a randomized password\nfor system users. This functionality is enabled at runtime by\npassing cloud-config data such as:\n\n\nchpasswd:\n list: |\n user1:RANDOM\n\n\nWhen used this way, cloud-init logs the raw, unhashed password to a\nworld-readable local file.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.7.9-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cloud-init packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of cloud-init please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cloud-init>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
