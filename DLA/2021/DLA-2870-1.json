	"summary": "apache-log4j2 - security update",
	"details": "\nApache Log4j2, a Java Logging Framework, is vulnerable to a remote code\nexecution (RCE) attack where an attacker with permission to modify the logging\nconfiguration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC\nAppender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote\ncode. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java\nprotocol.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.12.4-0+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache-log4j2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache-log4j2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache-log4j2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
