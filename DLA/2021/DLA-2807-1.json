	"details": "\n* [CVE-2021-25219](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-25219)\nKishore Kumar Kothapalli discovered that the lame server cache in BIND,\n a DNS server implementation, can be abused by an attacker to\n significantly degrade resolver performance, resulting in denial of\n service (large delays for responses for client queries and DNS timeouts\n on client hosts).\n* [CVE-2018-5740](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5740)\n\"deny-answer-aliases\" is a little-used feature intended to help recursive\n server operators protect end users against DNS rebinding attacks, a\n potential method of circumventing the security model used by client\n browsers. However, a defect in this feature makes it easy, when the\n feature is in use, to experience an assertion failure in name.c.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.3+deb9u10.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of bind9 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bind9>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
