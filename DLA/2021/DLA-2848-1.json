A remote attacker who compromises a\n SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial\n of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.\n* [CVE-2019-17498](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17498):\n\n SSH\\_MSG\\_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check,\n enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a\n subsequent memory read. A crafted SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive\n information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when\n a user connects to the server.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.7.0-1+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libssh2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libssh2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libssh2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
