It\nneglected to repeatedly call this function as required by the design of the\nAPI.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-15523](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15523)\nAn issue was discovered in LINBIT csync2 through 2.0. It does not\n correctly check for the return value GNUTLS\\_E\\_WARNING\\_ALERT\\_RECEIVED of the\n gnutls\\_handshake() function. It neglects to call this function again, as\n required by the design of the API.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.0-8-g175a01c-4+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your csync2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
