A local user\n could use these to obtain sensitive information from kernel\n memory.\n* [CVE-2021-3348](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3348)\nADlab of venustech discovered a race condition in the nbd block\n driver that can lead to a use-after-free. A local user with\n access to an nbd block device could use this to cause a denial of\n service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-3428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3428)\nWolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the\n ext4 filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary\n filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of service\n (crash).\n* [CVE-2021-26930](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26930)\n(XSA-365)\n\n\nOlivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan\n H. SchĂśnherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver\n (xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A\n malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of\n service (crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege\n escalation, within the domain running the backend, which is\n typically dom0.\n* [CVE-2021-26931](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26931)\n(XSA-362), [CVE-2021-26932](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26932) (XSA-361), [CVE-2021-28038](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28038) (XSA-367)\n\n\nJan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen\n backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A\n malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of\n service (crash) within the domain running the backend, which is\n typically dom0.\n* [CVE-2021-27363](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27363)\nAdam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not\n properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs.\n On a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information\n leak to local users and makes it easier to exploit [CVE-2021-27364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27364).\n* [CVE-2021-27364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27364)\nAdam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not\n properly restrict access to its netlink management interface. On\n a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use\n these to cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-27365](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27365)\nAdam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not\n correctly limit the lengths of parameters or passthrough PDUs\n sent through its netlink management interface. On a system acting\n as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the\n contents of kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel\n memory corruption or crash), and probably for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-28660](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28660)\nIt was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly\n limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker\n within WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service\n (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a\n vulnerable system.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.19.181-1~deb9u1. This update additionally fixes Debian bug\n#983595, and includes many more bug fixes from stable updates\n4.19.172-4.19.181 inclusive.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-4.19>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
