If you are using SAML authentication, use sogo-tool to immediately\ndelete users sessions and force all users to visit the login page:\n\n\nsogo-tool -v expire-sessions 1\n\n\nsystemctl restart memcached\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of sogo please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sogo>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
