	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-19318](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19318), [CVE-2019-19813](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19813), [CVE-2019-19816](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19816)\nTeam bobfuzzer reported bugs in Btrfs that could lead to a\n use-after-free or heap buffer overflow, and could be triggered by\n crafted filesystem images. A user permitted to mount and access\n arbitrary filesystems could use these to cause a denial of service\n (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-27815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27815)\nA flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local\n attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a\n denial of service.\n* [CVE-2020-27825](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27825)\nAdam pi3 Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace\n ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could\n result in denial of service or information leak.\n* [CVE-2020-28374](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-28374)\nDavid Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation\n performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An\n attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number\n assignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any\n LIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.\n* [CVE-2020-29568](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29568) ([XSA-349](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-349.html))\n\n Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can\n trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.\n* [CVE-2020-29569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29569) ([XSA-350](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-350.html))\n\n Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free\n flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A\n misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously\n connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.\n* [CVE-2020-29660](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29660)\nJann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty\n subsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount a\n read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.\n* [CVE-2020-29661](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29661)\nJann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can\n result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of\n this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-36158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36158)\nA buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver\n which could result in denial of service or the execution of\n arbitrary code via a long SSID value.\n* [CVE-2021-3178](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3178)\nĺ´ĺź reported an information leak in the NFSv3 server. When only\n a subdirectory of a filesystem volume is exported, an NFS client\n listing the exported directory would obtain a file handle to the\n parent directory, allowing it to access files that were not meant\n to be exported.\n\n\nEven after this update, it is still possible for NFSv3 clients to\n guess valid file handles and access files outside an exported\n subdirectory, unless the subtree\\_check export option is enabled.\n It is recommended that you do not use that option but only export\n whole filesystem volumes.\n* [CVE-2021-3347](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3347)\nIt was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free\n during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to\n crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-26930](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26930) ([XSA-365](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-365.html))\n\n Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan\n H. SchĂśnherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver\n (xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A\n malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of\n service (crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege\n escalation, within the domain running the backend, which is\n typically dom0.\n* [CVE-2021-26931](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26931) ([XSA-362](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-362.html)), [CVE-2021-26932](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26932) ([XSA-361](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-361.html)), [CVE-2021-28038](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28038) ([XSA-367](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-367.html))\n\n Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen\n backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly. A\n malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of\n service (crash) within the domain running the backend, which is\n typically dom0.\n* [CVE-2021-27363](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27363)\nAdam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not\n properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs.\n On a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information\n leak to local users and makes it easier to exploit [CVE-2021-27364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27364).\n* [CVE-2021-27364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27364)\nAdam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not\n properly restrict access to its netlink management interface. On\n a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use\n these to cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-27365](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27365)\nAdam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not\n correctly limit the lengths of parameters or passthrough PDUs\n sent through its netlink management interface. On a system acting\n as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the\n contents of kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel\n memory corruption or crash), and probably for privilege\n escalation.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.9.258-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
