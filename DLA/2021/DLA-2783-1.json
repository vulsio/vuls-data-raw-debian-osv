	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an integer-overflow vulnerability in\nhiredis, a C client library for communicating with Redis databases. This\noccurred within the handling and parsing of 'multi-bulk' replies.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-32765](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-32765)\nHiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. In\n affected versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided\n maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When\n parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count\n \\* sizeof(redisReply\\*)` can be represented in `SIZE\\_MAX`. If it can not, and\n the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a\n short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow. Users of hiredis who are\n unable to update may set the\n [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements)\n context option to a value small enough that no overflow is\n possible.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.13.3-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your hiredis packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
