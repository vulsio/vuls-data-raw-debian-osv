	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Squid, a proxy caching\nserver.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-28651](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28651)\nDue to a buffer-management bug, it allows a denial of service.\n When resolving a request with the urn: scheme, the parser leaks a\n small amount of memory. However, there is an unspecified attack\n methodology that can easily trigger a large amount of memory\n consumption.\n* [CVE-2021-28652](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28652)\nDue to incorrect parser validation, it allows a Denial of Service\n attack against the Cache Manager API. This allows a trusted client\n to trigger memory leaks that. over time, lead to a Denial of\n Service via an unspecified short query string. This attack is\n limited to clients with Cache Manager API access privilege.\n* [CVE-2021-31806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31806)\nDue to a memory-management bug, it is vulnerable to a Denial of\n Service attack (against all clients using the proxy) via HTTP\n Range request processing.\n* [CVE-2021-31807](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31807)\nAn integer overflow problem allows a remote server to achieve\n Denial of Service when delivering responses to HTTP Range\n requests. The issue trigger is a header that can be expected to\n exist in HTTP traffic without any malicious intent.\n* [CVE-2021-31808](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31808)\nDue to an input-validation bug, it is vulnerable to a Denial of\n Service attack (against all clients using the proxy). A client\n sends an HTTP Range request to trigger this.\n* [CVE-2021-33620](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33620)\nRemote servers to cause a denial of service (affecting\n availability to all clients) via an HTTP response. The issue\n trigger is a header that can be expected to exist in HTTP traffic\n without any malicious intent by the server.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.5.23-5+deb9u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of squid3 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squid3>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
