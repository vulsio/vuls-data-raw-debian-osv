	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the Apache HTTP server.\nAn attacker could send proxied requests to arbitrary servers, corrupt\nmemory in some setups involving third-party modules, and cause the\nserver to crash.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-34798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-34798)\nMalformed requests may cause the server to dereference\n a NULL pointer.\n* [CVE-2021-39275](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39275)\nap\\_escape\\_quotes() may write beyond the end of a buffer when given\n malicious input. No included modules pass untrusted data to these\n functions, but third-party / external modules may.\n* [CVE-2021-40438](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-40438)\nA crafted request uri-path can cause mod\\_proxy to forward the\n request to an origin server choosen by the remote user.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.4.25-3+deb9u11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
