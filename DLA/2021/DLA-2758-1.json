	"details": "\nOne security issue has been discovered in sssd.\n\n\nThe sssctl command was vulnerable to shell command injection via the logs-fetch\nand cache-expire subcommands. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the root\nuser into running a specially crafted sssctl command, such as via sudo, to gain\nroot access. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,\nintegrity, as well as system availability.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.15.0-3+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sssd packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of sssd please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sssd>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
