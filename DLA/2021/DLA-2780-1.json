	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilites in ruby2.3, interpreter of object-oriented\nscripting language Ruby, were discovered.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-31799](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31799)\nIn RDoc 3.11 through 6.x before 6.3.1, as distributed with\n Ruby through 2.3.3, it is possible to execute arbitrary\n code via | and tags in a filename.\n* [CVE-2021-31810](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31810)\nAn issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.3.3. A malicious\n FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into\n connecting back to a given IP address and port. This\n potentially makes curl extract information about services\n that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the\n attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n* [CVE-2021-32066](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-32066)\nAn issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.3.3. Net::IMAP does\n not raise an exception when StartTLS fails with an an unknown\n response, which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to\n bypass the TLS protections by leveraging a network position\n between the client and the registry to block the StartTLS\n command, aka a \"StartTLS stripping attack.\"\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.3.3-1+deb9u10.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.3 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of ruby2.3 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby2.3>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
