	"summary": "unbound1.9 - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been corrected in unbound, a\nvalidating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. Support for the unbound DNS server\nhas been resumed, the sources can be found in the unbound1.9 source package.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-12662](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12662)\nUnbound has Insufficient Control of Network Message\n Volume, aka an NXNSAttack issue. This is triggered by random\n subdomains in the NSDNAME in NS records.\n* [CVE-2020-12663](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12663)\nUnbound has an infinite loop via malformed DNS answers received from\n upstream servers.\n* [CVE-2020-28935](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-28935)\nUnbound contains a local vulnerability that would allow for a local symlink\n attack. When writing the PID file Unbound creates the file if it is not\n there, or opens an existing file for writing. In case the file was already\n present, it would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink\n instead of a regular file.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.9.0-2+deb10u2~deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unbound1.9 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of unbound1.9 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/unbound1.9>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
