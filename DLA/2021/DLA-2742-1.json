By\n crafting a legitimate ffconcat file that references an image, followed by\n a file the triggers the tty demuxer, the contents of the second file will be\n copied into the output file verbatim (as long as the `-vcodec copy` option\n is passed to ffmpeg).\n* [CVE-2021-38114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38114)\nlibavcodec/dnxhddec.c does not check the return value of the init\\_vlc\n function.
