	"details": "\nViktor Szakats reported that libcurl, an URL transfer library, does\nnot strip off user credentials from the URL when automatically\npopulating the Referer HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP\nrequests. Sensitive authentication data may leak to the server that is\nthe target of the second HTTP request.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n7.52.1-5+deb9u14.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of curl please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
