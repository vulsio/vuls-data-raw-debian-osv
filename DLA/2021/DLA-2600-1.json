	"summary": "pygments - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a series of denial of service\nvulnerabilities in Pygments, a popular syntax highlighting library for Python.\n\n\nA number of regular expressions had exponential or cubic worst-case\ncomplexity which could cause a remote denial of service (DoS) when provided\nwith malicious input.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-27291](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27291)\nIn pygments 1.1+, fixed in 2.7.4, the lexers used to parse programming\n languages rely heavily on regular expressions. Some of the regular\n expressions have exponential or cubic worst-case complexity and are\n vulnerable to ReDoS. By crafting malicious input, an attacker can cause a\n denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.2.0+dfsg-1+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pygments packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
