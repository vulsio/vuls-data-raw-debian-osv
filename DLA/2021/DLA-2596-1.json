	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the shadow suite of login\ntools. An attacker may escalate privileges in specific configurations.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-20002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-20002)\nShadow incorrectly lists pts/0 and pts/1 as physical terminals in\n /etc/securetty. This allows local users to login as password-less\n users even if they are connected by non-physical means such as SSH\n (hence bypassing PAM's nullok\\_secure configuration). This notably\n affects environments such as virtual machines automatically\n generated with a default blank root password, allowing all local\n users to escalate privileges. It should be noted however that\n /etc/securetty will be dropped in Debian 11/bullseye.\n* [CVE-2017-12424](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12424)\nThe newusers tool could be made to manipulate internal data\n structures in ways unintended by the authors. Malformed input may\n lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory\n corruption) or other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a\n privilege boundary in, for example, certain web-hosting\n environments in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user\n account to create subaccounts.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:4.4-4.1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your shadow packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of shadow please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/shadow>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
