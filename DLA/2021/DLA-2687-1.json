	"details": "\nTwo security issues have been discovered in prosody:\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-32917](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-32917)\nThe proxy65 component allows open access by default, even if neither of the\n users has an XMPP account on the local server, allowing unrestricted use of\n the server's bandwidth.\n* [CVE-2021-32921](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-32921)\nAuthentication module does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing\n certain secret strings when running under Lua 5.2 or later. This can\n potentially be used in a timing attack to reveal the contents of secret\n strings to an attacker.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.9.12-2+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your prosody packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of prosody please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/prosody>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
