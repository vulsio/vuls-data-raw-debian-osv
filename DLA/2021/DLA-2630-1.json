A user with the ability to\n upload files (like an Author) can exploit an XML parsing issue\n in the Media Library leading to XXE attacks. This requires\n WordPress installation to be using PHP 8. Access to internal\n files is possible in a successful XXE attack.\n* [CVE-2021-29450](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-29450)\nWordpress is an open source CMS. One of the blocks in the\n WordPress editor can be exploited in a way that exposes\n password-protected posts and pages. This requires at least\n contributor privileges.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.7.20+dfsg-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wordpress>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
