This could be used by an attacker to\n execute arbitrary code in processes which called the affected\n functions.\n\n\nThe original glibc bug was reported by Peter Klotz.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, this issue has been fixed in eglibc version 2.11.3-4+deb6u4\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.\n\n\nThe other three CVEs fixed in Debian wheezy via [DSA 3142-1](./dsa-3142) have already been\nfixed in squeeze LTS via DLA [DLA 97-1](../2014/dla-97).\n\n\n",
