	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure\nSockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-3570](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3570)\nPieter Wuille of Blockstream reported that the bignum squaring\n (BN\\_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, which\n might make it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic\n protection mechanisms.\n* [CVE-2014-3571](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3571)\nMarkus Stenberg of Cisco Systems, Inc. reported that a carefully\n crafted DTLS message can cause a segmentation fault in OpenSSL due\n to a NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker could use this flaw\n to mount a denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2014-3572](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3572)\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that an\n OpenSSL client would accept a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH\n ciphersuite if the server key exchange message is omitted. This\n allows remote SSL servers to conduct ECDHE-to-ECDH downgrade attacks\n and trigger a loss of forward secrecy.\n* [CVE-2014-8275](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8275)\nAntti Karjalainen and Tuomo Untinen of the Codenomicon CROSS project\n and Konrad Kraszewski of Google reported various certificate\n fingerprint issues, which allow remote attackers to defeat a\n fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist protection mechanism.\n* [CVE-2015-0204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0204)\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that\n an OpenSSL client will accept the use of an ephemeral RSA key in a\n non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite, violating the TLS\n standard. This allows remote SSL servers to downgrade the security\n of the session.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in openssl version 0.9.8o-4squeeze19\n\n\n",
