A man-in-the-middle\n attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially\n crafted X.509 certificate. The fix for [CVE-2012-6153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6153) was intended to address\n the incomplete patch for [CVE-2012-5783](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5783). The issue is now completely resolved\n by applying this patch and the one for the previous CVEs\n\n\nThis upload was prepared by Markus Koschany.\n\n\n",
