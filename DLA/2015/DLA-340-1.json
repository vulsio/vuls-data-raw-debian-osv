	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation\nof Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-2695](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2695)\nIt was discovered that applications which call gss\\_inquire\\_context()\n on a partially-established SPNEGO context can cause the GSS-API\n library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a\n process crash.\n* [CVE-2015-2697](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2697)\nIt was discovered that the build\\_principal\\_va() function incorrectly\n handles input strings. An authenticated attacker can take advantage\n of this flaw to cause a KDC to crash using a TGS request with a\n large realm field beginning with a null byte.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been\nfixed in version 1.8.3+dfsg-4squeeze10.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.\n\n\n",
