	"summary": "linux-2.6 - security update",
	"details": "\nThis update fixes the CVEs described below.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-0272](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0272)\nIt was discovered that NetworkManager would set IPv6 MTUs based on\n the values received in IPv6 RAs (Router Advertisements), without\n sufficiently validating these values. A remote attacker could\n exploit this attack to disable IPv6 connectivity. This has been\n mitigated by adding validation in the kernel.\n* [CVE-2015-5156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5156)\nJason Wang discovered that when a virtio\\_net device is connected\n to a bridge in the same VM, a series of TCP packets forwarded\n through the bridge may cause a heap buffer overflow. A remote\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2015-5364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5364)\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle\n invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to\n cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid\n checksums.\n* [CVE-2015-5366](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5366)\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle\n invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of\n service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single\n packet with an invalid checksum.\n* [CVE-2015-5697](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5697)\nA flaw was discovered in the md driver in the Linux kernel leading\n to an information leak.\n* [CVE-2015-5707](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5707)\nAn integer overflow in the SCSI generic driver in the Linux kernel\n was discovered. A local user with write permission on a SCSI generic\n device could potentially exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2015-6937](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6937)\nIt was found that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol\n implementation did not verify that an underlying transport exists\n when creating a connection. Depending on how a local RDS\n application initialised its sockets, a remote attacker might be\n able to cause a denial of service (crash) by sending a crafted\n packet.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been\nfixed in version 2.6.32-48squeeze14.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been\nfixed in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u4 or earlier.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u4 or earlier.\n\n\n",
