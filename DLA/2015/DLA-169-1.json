	"details": "\nA vulnerability was fixed in axis, a SOAP implementation in Java:\n\n\nThe getCN function in Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not properly verify\n that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name\n (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows\n man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a certificate with a\n subject that specifies a common name in a field that is not the CN field.\n\n\nThanks to Markus Koschany for providing the fixed package and David Jorm\n and Arun Neelicattu (Red Hat Product Security) for providing the patch.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in axis version 1.4-12+deb6u1\n\n\n",
