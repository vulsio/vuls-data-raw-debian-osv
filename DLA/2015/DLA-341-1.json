It is possible to\n use-after-free attack and execute arbitrary code remotely.\n* [CVE-2015-6832](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6832)\nDangling pointer in the unserialization of ArrayObject items.\n* [CVE-2015-6833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6833)\nFiles extracted from archive may be placed outside of destination\n directory\n* [CVE-2015-6834](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6834)\nUse after free vulnerability was found in unserialize() function.\n We can create ZVAL and free it via Serializable::unserialize.\n However the unserialize() will still allow to use R: or r: to set\n references to that already freed memory. It is possible to\n use-after-free attack and execute arbitrary code remotely.\n* [CVE-2015-6836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6836)\nA type confusion occurs within SOAP serialize\\_function\\_call due\n to an insufficient validation of the headers field.\n In the SoapClient's \\_\\_call method, the verify\\_soap\\_headers\\_array\n check is applied only to headers retrieved from\n zend\\_parse\\_parameters; problem is that a few lines later,\n soap\\_headers could be updated or even replaced with values from\n the \\_\\_default\\_headers object fields.\n* [CVE-2015-6837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6837)\nThe XSLTProcessor class misses a few checks on the input from the\n libxslt library. The valuePop() function call is able to return\n NULL pointer and php does not check that.\n* [CVE-2015-6838](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6838)\nThe XSLTProcessor class misses a few checks on the input from the\n libxslt library.

A specially crafted archive could\n cause PHP to crash.\n* [CVE-2015-7804](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7804)\nAn uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the\n phar\\_make\\_dirstream() function of PHP's Phar extension.\n A specially crafted phar file in the ZIP format with a directory\n entry with a file name \"/ZIP\" could cause a PHP application\n function to crash.\n\n\n",
