Furthermore, it\nintroduced an issue, since invalid dns packets caused an infinite loop.\nThis upload corrects these problems.\n\n\nAs of today, no CVEs has been assigned to these Debian-specific flaws.\n\n\nFor the Squeeze distribution, these issues have been fixed in version\n1.1.22+dfsg-4+squeeze2 of inspircd.\n\n\n",
