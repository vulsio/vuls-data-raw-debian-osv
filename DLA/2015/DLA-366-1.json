	"details": "\nIt has been reported that arts uses the insecure mktemp() function\nto create the temporary directory it uses to host user-specific sockets.\nIt is thus possible for another user to hijack this temporary directory\nand gain IPC access it should not have.\n\n\nIn Debian 6 Squeeze, this issue has been addressed in arts\n1.5.9-3+deb6u1 with the use of the safer mkdtemp() function.\nWe recommend that you upgrade your arts packages.\n\n\nOther Debian releases do not have the arts package.\n\n\n",
