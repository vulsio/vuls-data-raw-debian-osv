	"details": "\nThis update fixes the CVEs described below.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-2925](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2925)\nJann Horn discovered that when a subdirectory of a filesystem was\n bind-mounted into a chroot or mount namespace, a user that should\n be confined to that chroot or namespace could access the whole of\n that filesystem if they had write permission on an ancestor of\n the subdirectory. This is not a common configuration for this\n kernel version.\n* [CVE-2015-5257](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5257)\nMoein Ghasemzadeh of Istuary Innovation Labs reported that a USB\n device could cause a denial of service (crash) by imitating a\n Whiteheat USB serial device but presenting a smaller number of\n endpoints.\n* [CVE-2015-7613](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7613)\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that System V IPC objects (message queues\n and shared memory segments) were made accessible before their\n ownership and other attributes were fully initialised. If a local\n user can race against another user or service creating a new IPC\n object, this may result in unauthorised information disclosure,\n unauthorised information modification, denial of service and/or\n privilege escalation.\n\n\nA similar issue existed with System V semaphore arrays, but was\n less severe because they were always cleared before being fully\n initialised.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been\nfixed in version 2.6.32-48squeeze16.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed\nin version 3.2.68-1+deb7u5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed\nin version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u5 or have been fixed earlier.\n\n\n",
