	"details": "\nIn Debian LTS (squeeze), the fix for [CVE-2015-5600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5600) in openssh\n1:5.5p1-6+squeeze7 breaks authentication mechanisms that rely on the\nkeyboard-interactive method. Thanks to Colin Watson for making aware of\nthat.\n\n\nThe patch fixing [CVE-2015-5600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5600) introduces the field devices\\_done to the\nKbdintAuthctxt struct, but does not initialize the field in the\nkbdint\\_alloc() function. On Linux, this ends up filling that field with\njunk data. The result of this are random login failures when\nkeyboard-interactive authentication is used.\n\n\nThis upload of openssh 1:5.5p1-6+squeeze7 to Debian LTS (squeeze) adds\nthat initialization of the `devices\\_done` field alongside the existing\ninitialization code.\n\n\nPeople relying on keyboard-interactive based authentication mechanisms with\nOpenSSH on Debian squeeze(-lts) systems are recommended to upgrade\nOpenSSH to 1:5.5p1-6+squeeze7.\n\n\n",
