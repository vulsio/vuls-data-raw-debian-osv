The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-0556](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0556)\nJakub Wilk discovered that arj follows symlinks created during\n unpacking of an arj archive. A remote attacker could use this flaw\n to perform a directory traversal attack if a user or automated\n system were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.\n* [CVE-2015-0557](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0557)\nJakub Wilk discovered that arj does not sufficiently protect from\n directory traversal while unpacking an arj archive containing file\n paths with multiple leading slashes. A remote attacker could use\n this flaw to write to arbitrary files if a user or automated system\n were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.\n* [CVE-2015-2782](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2782)\nJakub Wilk and Guillem Jover discovered a buffer overflow\n vulnerability in arj. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause\n an application crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the\n privileges of the user running arj.\n\n\n",
