This is\n similar to the issue fixed in DSA-2849-1.\n* [CVE-2015-3148](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3148)\nWhen doing HTTP requests using the Negotiate authentication method\n along with NTLM, the connection used would not be marked as\n authenticated, making it possible to reuse it and send requests for\n one user over the connection authenticated as a different user.\n\n\n",
