	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities were identified in the Ruby language interpreter,\nversion 1.9.1.\n\n\n* [CVE-2012-5371](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5371)\nJean-Philippe Aumasson identified that Ruby computed hash values\n without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions\n predictably, allowing context-dependent attackers to cause a denial\n of service (CPU consumption). This is a different vulnerability than\n [CVE-2011-4815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4815).\n* [CVE-2013-0269](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0269)\nThomas Hollstegge and Ben Murphy found that the JSON gem for Ruby\n allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource\n consumption) or bypass the mass assignment protection mechanism via\n a crafted JSON document that triggers the creation of arbitrary Ruby\n symbols or certain internal objects.\n\n\nFor the squeeze distribution, theses vulnerabilities have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.2.0-2+deb6u5 of ruby1.9.1. We recommend that you upgrade\nyour ruby1.9.1 package.\n\n\n",
