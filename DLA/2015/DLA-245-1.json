	"details": "\nAlexander Cherepanov discovered that p7zip is susceptible to a\ndirectory traversal vulnerability. While extracting an archive, it\nwill extract symlinks and then follow them if they are referenced in\nfurther entries. This can be exploited by a rogue archive to write\nfiles outside the current directory.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been\nfixed in version 9.04~dfsg.1-1+deb6u1.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy) and stable distribution\n(jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\n",
