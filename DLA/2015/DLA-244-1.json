Patrakov discovered an issue in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec\nsuite used to establish IPsec protected links.\n\n\nWhen a client authenticate the server with certificates and the client\nauthenticates using pre-shared key or EAP, the constraints on the server\ncertificate are only enforced by the client after all authentication\nsteps are completed successfully. A rogue server which can authenticate\nusing a valid certificate issued by any CA trusted by the client could\ntrick the user into continuing the authentication, revealing the\nusername and password digest (for EAP) or even the cleartext password\n(if EAP-GTC is accepted).\n\n\n",
