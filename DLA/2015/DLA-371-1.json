	"details": "\nAdam Chester discovered that there was an injection vulnerability in\nfoomatic-filters which is used by printer spoolers to convert\nincoming PostScript data into the printer's native format. This\ncould lead to the execution of arbitrary commands.\n\n\nThe patch applied in [DLA 365-1](./dla-365) prevented usage of (unescaped) backticks\nand this update complements the previous update by doing the same for\nsemi-colons.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, this issue has been fixed in foomatic-filters\nversion 4.0.5-6+squeeze2+deb6u12.\n\n\n(Thanks to Yann Soubeyrand who prepared the updated Debian package)\n\n\n",
