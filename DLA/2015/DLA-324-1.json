If the linker is used with untrusted object files, this\n would allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)\n or possibly privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2012-3509](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3509), #688951\n\n Sang Kil Cha discovered that a buffer size calculation in\n libiberty, part of binutils, may result in integer overflow and\n then a heap buffer overflow. If libiberty or the commands in\n binutils are used to read untrusted binaries, this would allow\n remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly\n privilege escalation.\n* PR binutils/18750 (no CVE assigned)\n\n Joshua Rogers reported that passing a malformed ihex (Intel\n hexadecimal) file to to various commands in binutils may result in\n a stack buffer overflow. A similar issue was found in readelf.\n If these commands are used to read untrusted binaries, this would\n allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or\n possibly privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been\nfixed in version 2.20.1-16+deb6u2.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy) and the stable distribution\n(jessie), PR ld/12613 and [CVE-2012-3509](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3509) were fixed before release, and\nPR binutils/18750 will be fixed in a later update.\n\n\n",
