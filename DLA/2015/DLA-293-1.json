Michael Pilato, from CollabNet, reported an issue in the version\ncontrol system Subversion.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-3187](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3187)\nSubversion servers revealed some sensible paths hidden by path-based\n authorization. Remote authenticated users were allowed to obtain\n path information by reading the history of a node that has been\n moved from a hidden path. The vulnerability only revealed the path,\n though it didn't reveal its content.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, this issue has been fixed in subversion\n1.6.12dfsg-7+deb6u3. We recommend to upgrade your subversion packages.\n\n\n",
