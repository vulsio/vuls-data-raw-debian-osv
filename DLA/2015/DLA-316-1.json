	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in eglibc that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.\n\n\n* Glibc pointer guarding weakness\n\n A weakness in the dynamic loader prior has been found. The issue is\n that the LD\\_POINTER\\_GUARD in the environment is not sanitized\n allowing local attackers easily to bypass the pointer guarding\n protection on set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.\n* Potential application crash due to overread in fnmatch\n\n When processing certain malformed patterns, fnmatch can skip over the\n NUL byte terminating the pattern. This can potentially result in an\n application crash if fnmatch hits an unmapped page before\n encountering a NUL byte.\n* \\_IO\\_wstr\\_overflow integer overflow\n\n A miscalculation in \\_IO\\_wstr\\_overflow could potentially be exploited\n to overflow a buffer.\n* [CVE-2014-8121](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8121)\nDB\\_LOOKUP in nss\\_files/files-XXX.c in the Name Service Switch (NSS)\n in GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.21 and earlier does not\n properly check if a file is open, which allows remote attackers to\n cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by performing a look-up\n while the database is iterated over the database, which triggers the\n file pointer to be reset.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2.11.3-4+deb6u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your packages.\n\n\n",
