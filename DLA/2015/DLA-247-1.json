	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Sockets\nLayer toolkit.\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-8176](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8176)\nPraveen Kariyanahalli, Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert discovered\n that an invalid memory free could be triggered when buffering DTLS\n data. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code. This issue only\n affected the oldstable distribution (wheezy).\n* [CVE-2015-1789](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1789)\nRobert Swiecki and Hanno BĂśck discovered that the X509\\_cmp\\_time\n function could read a few bytes out of bounds. This could allow remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted\n certificates and CRLs.\n* [CVE-2015-1790](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1790)\nMichal Zalewski discovered that the PKCS#7 parsing code did not\n properly handle missing content which could lead to a NULL pointer\n dereference. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service (crash) via crafted ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs.\n* [CVE-2015-1791](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1791)\nEmilia KĂ¤sper discovered that a race condition could occur due to\n incorrect handling of NewSessionTicket in a multi-threaded client,\n leading to a double free. This could allow remote attackers to cause\n a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2015-1792](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1792)\nJohannes Bauer discovered that the CMS code could enter an infinite\n loop when verifying a signedData message, if presented with an\n unknown hash function OID. This could allow remote attackers to cause\n a denial of service.\n\n\nAdditionally OpenSSL will now reject handshakes using DH parameters\nshorter than 768 bits as a countermeasure against the Logjam attack\n([CVE-2015-4000](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4000)).\n\n\n",
