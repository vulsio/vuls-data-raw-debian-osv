	"summary": "wesnoth-1.8 - security update",
	"details": "\nWesnoth implements a text preprocessing language that is used in\n conjunction with its own game scripting language. It also has a\n built-in Lua interpreter and API.\n Both the Lua API and the preprocessor make use of the same function\n (filesystem::get\\_wml\\_location()) to resolve file paths so that only\n content from the user's data directory can be read.\n\n\nHowever, the function did not explicitly disallow files with the .pbl\n extension. The contents of these files could thus be stored in saved\n game files or even transmitted directly to other users in a networked\n game. Among the information that's compromised is a user-defined\n passphrase used to authenticate uploads to the game's content server.\n\n\n",
