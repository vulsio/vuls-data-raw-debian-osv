	"details": "\nThis update fixes the CVEs described below.\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-0106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0106)\nTodd C. Miller reported that if the env\\_reset option is disabled\n in the sudoers file, the env\\_delete option is not correctly\n applied to environment variables specified on the command line. A\n malicious user with sudo permissions may be able to run arbitrary\n commands with elevated privileges by manipulating the environment\n of a command the user is legitimately allowed to run.\n* [CVE-2014-9680](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9680)\nJakub Wilk reported that sudo preserves the TZ variable from a\n user's environment without any sanitization. A user with sudo\n access may take advantage of this to exploit bugs in the C library\n functions which parse the TZ environment variable or to open files\n that the user would not otherwise be able to open. The latter\n could potentially cause changes in system behavior when reading\n certain device special files or cause the program run via sudo to\n block.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.7.4p4-2.squeeze.5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), they have been fixed in version\n1.8.5p2-1+nmu2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.\n\n\n",
