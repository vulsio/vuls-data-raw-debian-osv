Thanks\nto Gianfranco Costamagna for preparing packages for review and upload by\nthe Debian LTS Team.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Oracle no longer provides information on specific security\nvulnerabilities in VirtualBox, thus we provide their latest 3.2.28\nmaintenance release in Debian LTS (squeeze) directly.\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-3792](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3792)\nOracle reported an unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle VM\n VirtualBox component in Oracle Virtualization VirtualBox prior to\n 3.2.18, 4.0.20, 4.1.28, and 4.2.18 allows local users to affect\n availability via unknown vectors related to Core.\n\n\nThe fix for [CVE-2013-3792](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3792) prevents a virtio-net host DoS\n vulnerability by adding large frame support to IntNet, VirtioNet and\n NetFilter plus dropping oversized frames.\n* [CVE-2014-2486](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2486)\nUnspecified vulnerability in the Oracle VM VirtualBox component\n in Oracle Virtualization VirtualBox before 3.2.24, 4.0.26,\n 4.1.34, 4.2.26, and 4.3.12 allows local users to affect integrity\n and availability via unknown vectors related to Core.\n\n\nNo further details have been provided, the attack range has been\n given as local, severity low.\n* [CVE-2014-2488](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2488)\nUnspecified vulnerability in the Oracle VM VirtualBox component in\n Oracle Virtualization VirtualBox before 3.2.24, 4.0.26, 4.1.34,\n 4.2.26, and 4.3.12 allows local users to affect confidentiality via\n unknown vectors related to Core.\n\n\nNo further details can been provided, the attack range has been\n given as local, severity low.\n* [CVE-2014-2489](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2489)\nUnspecified vulnerability in the Oracle VM VirtualBox component in\n Oracle Virtualization VirtualBox before 3.2.24, 4.0.26, 4.1.34,\n 4.2.26, and 4.3.12 allows local users to affect confidentiality,\n integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Core.\n\n\nNo further details can been provided, the attack range has been\n given as local, severity medium.\n* [CVE-2015-2594](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2594)\nUnspecified vulnerability in the Oracle VM VirtualBox component\n in Oracle Virtualization VirtualBox prior to 4.0.32, 4.1.40,\n 4.2.32, and 4.3.30 allows local users to affect confidentiality,\n integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Core.\n\n\nThis update fixes an issue related to guests using bridged networking\n via WiFi.\n\n\n",
