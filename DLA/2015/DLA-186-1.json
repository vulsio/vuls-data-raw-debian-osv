Installations using a transport script (such as\npostfix-to-mailman.py) to interface with their MTA instead of static\naliases were vulnerable to a path traversal attack. To successfully\nexploit this, an attacker needs write access on the local file system.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in mailman version 1:2.1.13-6\n\n\n",
