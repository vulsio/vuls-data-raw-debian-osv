	"details": "\nJohn Lightsey discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Module::Signature,\na Perl module to manipulate CPAN SIGNATURE files. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-3406](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3406)\nModule::Signature could parse the unsigned portion of the SIGNATURE\n file as the signed portion due to incorrect handling of PGP signature\n boundaries.\n* [CVE-2015-3407](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3407)\nModule::Signature incorrectly handled files that are not listed in\n the SIGNATURE file. This includes some files in the t/ directory\n that would execute when tests are run.\n* [CVE-2015-3408](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3408)\nModule::Signature used two argument open() calls to read the files\n when generating checksums from the signed manifest. This allowed to\n embed arbitrary shell commands into the SIGNATURE file that would be\n executed during the signature verification process.\n* [CVE-2015-3409](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3409)\nModule::Signature incorrectly handled module loading, allowing to\n load modules from relative paths in @INC. A remote attacker\n providing a malicious module could use this issue to execute\n arbitrary code during signature verification.\n\n\nFor the squeeze distribution, these issues have been fixed in version\n0.63-1+squeeze2 of libmodule-signature-perl. Please note that the\nlibtest-signature-perl package was also updated for compatibility with\nthe [CVE-2015-3407](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3407) fix.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libmodule-signature-perl and\nlibtest-signature-perl packages.\n\n\n",
