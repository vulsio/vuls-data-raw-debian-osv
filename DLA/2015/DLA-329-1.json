	"summary": "postgresql-8.4 - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral bugs were discovered in PostgreSQL, a relational database server\nsystem. The 8.4 branch is EOLed upstream, but still present in Debian squeeze.\nThis new LTS minor version contains the fixes that were applied upstream to the\n9.0.22 version, backported to 8.4.22 which was the last version officially\nreleased by the PostgreSQL developers. This LTS effort for squeeze-lts is a\ncommunity project sponsored by credativ GmbH.\n\n\n### Migration to Version 8.4.22lts5\n\n\nA dump/restore is not required for those running 8.4.X. However, if you are\nupgrading from a version earlier than 8.4.22, see the relevant release notes.\n\n\n### Security Fixes\n\n\nFix contrib/pgcrypto to detect and report too-short crypt salts (Josh\nKupershmidt)\n\n\nCertain invalid salt arguments crashed the server or disclosed a few\nbytes of server memory. We have not ruled out the viability of attacks\nthat arrange for presence of confidential information in the disclosed\nbytes, but they seem unlikely.
