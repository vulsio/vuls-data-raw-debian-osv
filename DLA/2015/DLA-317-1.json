This issue has been fixed\n upstream by providing a fix for [CVE-2014-9639](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9639). Reported upstream by\n zuBux.\n* [CVE-2014-9639](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9639)\nAn integer overflow issue was discovered in oggenc, related to the\n number of channels in the input WAV file. The issue triggers an\n out-of-bounds memory access which causes oggenc to crash here\n (audio.c). Reported upstream by zuBux.\n\n\nThe upstream fix for this has been backported to vorbis-tools in\n Debian LTS (squeeze).\n* [CVE-2014-9640](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9640)\nFix for a crash on closing raw input (dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=1 |\n oggenc -r - -o out.ogg). Reported upstream by hanno.\n\n\nThe upstream fix for this has been backported to vorbis-tools in\n Debian LTS (squeeze).\n* [CVE-2015-6749](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6749)\nBuffer overflow in the aiff\\_open function in oggenc/audio.c in\n vorbis-tools 1.4.0 and earlier allowed remote attackers to cause a\n denial of service (crash) via a crafted AIFF file. Reported upstream\n by pengsu.\n\n\nThe upstream fix for this has been backported to vorbis-tools in\n Debian LTS (squeeze).\n\n\n",
