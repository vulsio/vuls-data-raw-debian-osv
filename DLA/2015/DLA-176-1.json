Which would allow\n various attacks on the protocol to succeed. (\"SKIP-TLS\")\n* [CVE-2015-2319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2319)\nMono's implementation of SSL/TLS also contained support for\n the weak EXPORT cyphers and was susceptible to the FREAK attack.\n* [CVE-2015-2320](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2320)\nMono contained SSLv2 fallback code, which is no longer needed\n and can be considered insecure.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in mono version 2.6.7-5.1+deb6u1\n\n\n",
