A remote attacker who can cause a validating resolver\n to query a zone containing specifically constructed contents can\n cause the resolver to terminate with an assertion failure, resulting\n in a denial of service to clients relying on the resolver.\n\n\nFor the squeeze distribution, these issues have been fixed in version\n9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze15 of bind9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\n",
