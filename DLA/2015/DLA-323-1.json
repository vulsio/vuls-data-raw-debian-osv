	"details": "\nThe following two issues have recently been fixed in Debian LTS (squeeze)\nfor the fuseiso package.\n\n\nIssue 1\n\n\nAn integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow flaw was\n found in the way FuseISO, a FUSE module to mount ISO filesystem\n images, performed reading of certain ZF blocks of particular inodes.\n A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted ISO file that,\n when mounted via the fuseiso tool would lead to fuseiso binary crash.\n\n\nThis issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product\n Security Team.\n\n\nThe issue got resolve by bailing out before ZF blocks that exceed the\n supported block size of 2^17 are to be read.\n\n\nIssue 2\n\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way FuseISO, a\n FUSE module to mount ISO filesystem images, performed expanding of\n directory portions for absolute path filename entries. A remote\n attacker could provide a specially-crafted ISO file that, when\n mounted via fuseiso tool would lead to fuseiso binary crash or,\n potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user\n running the fuseiso executable.\n\n\nThis issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product\n Security Team.\n\n\nThe issue got resolved by checking the resulting length of an\n absolute path name and by bailing out if the platform's PATH\\_MAX\n value gets exceeded.\n\n\n",
