	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-3591](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3591)\nThe Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel\n attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext\n blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a quite\n noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.\n* [CVE-2015-0837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0837)\nThe modular exponentiation routine mpi\\_powm() was susceptible to a\n side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when\n accessing its internal pre-computed table.\n* [CVE-2015-1606](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1606)\nThe keyring parsing code did not properly reject certain packet types\n not belonging in a keyring, which caused an access to memory already\n freed. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (crash) via crafted keyring files.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.10-4+squeeze7.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.12-7+deb7u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.\n\n\n",
