	"details": "\nAn information disclosure flaw due to incorrect JkMount/JkUnmount\ndirectives processing was found in the Apache 2 module mod\\_jk to forward\nrequests from the Apache web server to Tomcat. A JkUnmount rule for a subtree\nof a previous JkMount rule could be ignored. This could allow a remote attacker\nto potentially access a private artifact in a tree that would otherwise not be\naccessible to them.\n\n\nFor the squeeze distribution, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:1.2.30-1squeeze2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-jk packages.\n\n\nThis update has been prepared by Markus Koschany.\n\n\n",
