	"details": "\nSeveral issues have been discovered and fixed in Tor, a connection-based\nlow-latency anonymous communication system.\n\n\no Jowr discovered that very high DNS query load on a relay could\n trigger an assertion error.\n\n\no A relay could crash with an assertion error if a buffer of exactly\n the wrong layout was passed to buf\\_pullup() at exactly the wrong\n time.\n\n\no When sending the address of the chosen rendezvous point to a hidden\n service clients were leaking to the hidden service they were on a\n little-endian or big-endian systems.\n\n\nFurthermore, this update disables support for SSLv3 in Tor. All\nversions of OpenSSL in use with Tor today support TLS 1.0 or later.\n\n\nAdditionally, this release updates the geoIP database used by Tor as\nwell as the list of directory authority servers, which Tor clients use\nto bootstrap and trust to sign the Tor directory consensus document.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in tor version 0.2.4.26-1~deb6u1\n\n\n",
