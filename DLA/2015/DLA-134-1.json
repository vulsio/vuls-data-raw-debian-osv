An attacker able to make an application using libcurl to\naccess a specially crafted URL via an HTTP proxy could use this flaw to\ndo additional requests in a way that was not intended, or insert\nadditional request headers into the request.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in curl version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze11\n\n\n",
