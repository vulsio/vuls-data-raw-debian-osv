	"details": "\nThijs Alkemade discovered that the Jabber server may pass an invalid\nUTF-8 string to libidn, the GNU library for Internationalized Domain\nNames (IDNs). In the case of the Jabber server, this results in\ninformation disclosure, and it is likely that some other applications\nusing libidn have similar vulnerabilities. This update changes libidn\nto check for invalid strings rather than assuming that the application\nhas done so.\n\n\nFor the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.15-2+deb6u1.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy) and stable distribution\n(jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\n",
