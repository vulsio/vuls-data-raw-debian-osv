	"summary": "linux-2.6 - security update",
	"details": "\nThis update fixes the CVEs described below.\n\n\nA further issue, [CVE-2014-9419](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9419), was considered, but appears to require\nextensive changes with a consequent high risk of regression. It is\nnow unlikely to be fixed in squeeze-lts.\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-6885](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6885)\nIt was discovered that under specific circumstances, a combination\n of write operations to write-combined memory and locked CPU\n instructions may cause a core hang on AMD 16h 00h through 0Fh\n processors. A local user can use this flaw to mount a denial of\n service (system hang) via a crafted application.\n\n\nFor more information please refer to the AMD CPU erratum 793 in\n <http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/51810_16h_00h-0Fh_Rev_Guide.pdf>\n* [CVE-2014-7822](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7822)\nIt was found that the splice() system call did not validate the\n given file offset and length. A local unprivileged user can use\n this flaw to cause filesystem corruption on ext4 filesystems, or\n possibly other effects.\n* [CVE-2014-8133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8133)\nIt was found that the espfix functionality can be bypassed by\n installing a 16-bit RW data segment into GDT instead of LDT (which\n espfix checks for) and using it for stack. A local unprivileged user\n could potentially use this flaw to leak kernel stack addresses.\n* [CVE-2014-8134](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8134)\nIt was found that the espfix functionality is wrongly disabled in\n a 32-bit KVM guest. A local unprivileged user could potentially\n use this flaw to leak kernel stack addresses.\n* [CVE-2014-8160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8160)\nIt was found that a netfilter (iptables or ip6tables) rule\n accepting packets to a specific SCTP, DCCP, GRE or UDPlite\n port/endpoint could result in incorrect connection tracking state.\n If only the generic connection tracking module (nf\\_conntrack) was\n loaded, and not the protocol-specific connection tracking module,\n this would allow access to any port/endpoint of the specified\n protocol.\n* [CVE-2014-9420](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9420)\nIt was found that the ISO-9660 filesystem implementation (isofs)\n follows arbitrarily long chains, including loops, of Continuation\n Entries (CEs). This allows local users to mount a denial of\n service via a crafted disc image.\n* [CVE-2014-9584](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9584)\nIt was found that the ISO-9660 filesystem implementation (isofs)\n does not validate a length value in the Extensions Reference (ER)\n System Use Field, which allows local users to obtain sensitive\n information from kernel memory via a crafted disc image.\n* [CVE-2014-9585](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9585)\nIt was discovered that address randomisation for the vDSO in\n 64-bit processes is extremely biassed. A local unprivileged user\n could potentially use this flaw to bypass the ASLR protection\n mechanism.\n* [CVE-2015-1421](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1421)\nIt was found that the SCTP implementation could free\n authentication state while it was still in use, resulting in heap\n corruption. This could allow remote users to cause a denial of\n service or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2015-1593](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1593)\nIt was found that address randomisation for the initial stack in\n 64-bit processes was limited to 20 rather than 22 bits of entropy.\n A local unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to\n bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in linux-2.6 version 2.6.32-48squeeze11\n\n\n",
