	"details": "\nSeveral bugs were discovered in PostgreSQL, a relational database server\nsystem. The 8.4 branch is EOLed upstream, but still present in Debian squeeze.\nThis new LTS minor version contains the fixes that were applied upstream to the\n9.0.22 version, backported to 8.4.22 which was the last version officially\nreleased by the PostgreSQL developers. This LTS effort for squeeze-lts is a\ncommunity project sponsored by credativ GmbH.\n\n\n## Migration to Version 8.4.22lts4\n\n\nA dump/restore is not required for those running 8.4.X. However, if you are\nupgrading from a version earlier than 8.4.22, see the relevant release notes.\n\n\n## Changes\n\n\n* Fix rare failure to invalidate relation cache init file (Tom Lane)\n\n With just the wrong timing of concurrent activity, a VACUUM FULL\n on a system catalog might fail to update the init file that's used to\n avoid cache-loading work for new sessions. This would result in\n later sessions being unable to access that catalog at all.\n This is a very ancient bug, but it's so hard to trigger that no\n reproducible case had been seen until recently.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these issues have been fixed in postgresql-8.4 version 8.4.22lts4-0+deb6u1\n\n\n",
