This\n could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via\n crafted XPM files.\n* [CVE-2014-9709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9709)\nImporting an invalid GIF file using the gdImageCreateFromGif() function\n would cause a read buffer overflow that could allow remote attackers to\n cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted GIF files.\n\n\n",
