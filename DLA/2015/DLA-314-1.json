	"details": "\nPetr Sklenar of Red Hat discovered that the texttopdf tool, part of cups\nfilters, was susceptible to multiple heap-based buffer and integer overflows\ndue to improper handling of print jobs. This could allow remote attackers to\ncrash texttopdf or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, this issue has been fixed in cups version\n1.4.4-7+squeeze10. For Wheezy and Jessie, this has been fixed in the\ncups-filter package. We recommend you to upgrade your cups packages.\n\n\n",
