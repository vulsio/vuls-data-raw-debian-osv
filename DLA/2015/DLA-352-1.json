	"details": "\nThe Apache commons collection suffered from security issues, making\napplications to accept serialized objects from untrusted sources. Remote\nattackers might take advantage of these issues to execute arbitrary Java\nfunctions and even inject manipulated bytecode.\n\n\nThis release of libcommons-collection3-java prevents these issues by disabling\nthe deserialization of the functors classes, unless the system property\norg.apache.commons.collections.enableUnsafeSerialization is set to true.\nClasses considered unsafe are: CloneTransformer, ForClosure,\nInstantiateFactory, InstantiateTransformer, InvokerTransformer,\nPrototypeCloneFactory, PrototypeSerializationFactory and WhileClosure.\n\n\nFor Debian 6 Squeeze, these problems have been fixed in\nlibcommons-collections3-java version 3.2.1-4+deb6u1. We recommend you to\nupgrade your libcommons-collections3-java packages.\n\n\n",
