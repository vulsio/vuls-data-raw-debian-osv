	"details": "\nTwo flaws were discovered in ruby-passenger for Ruby Rails and Rack\nsupport that allowed attackers to spoof HTTP headers or exploit a race\ncondition which made privilege escalation under certain conditions\npossible.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-7519](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7519)\nRemote attackers could spoof headers passed to applications by using\n an underscore character instead of a dash character in an HTTP\n header as demonstrated by an X\\_User header.\n* [CVE-2018-12029](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12029)\nA vulnerability was discovered by the Pulse Security team. It was\n exploitable only when running a non-standard\n passenger\\_instance\\_registry\\_dir, via a race condition where after a\n file was created, there was a window in which it could be replaced\n with a symlink before it was chowned via the path and not the file\n descriptor. If the symlink target was to a file which would be\n executed by root such as root's crontab file, then privilege\n escalation was possible. This is now mitigated by using fchown().\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.0.53-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-passenger packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
