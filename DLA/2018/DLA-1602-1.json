	"details": "\nAmong others, Andre Heinicke from gpg4win.org found several issues of\nnsis, a tool for creating quick and user friendly installers for\nMicrosoft Windows operating systems.\n\n\nThe issues are fixed by:\n\n\n* using SetDefaultDllDirectories() to restrict implicitly loaded and\n dynamically loaded modules to trusted directories\n* creating temporary directories in a way that only elevated users can\n write into it\n* not implicitly linking against Version.dll but using wrapper\n functions\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.46-10+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nsis packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
