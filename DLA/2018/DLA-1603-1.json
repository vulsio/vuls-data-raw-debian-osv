	"details": "\nSeveral issues were found in suricata, an intrusion detection and\nprevention tool.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-7177](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7177)\nSuricata has an IPv4 defragmentation evasion issue caused by lack\n of a check for the IP protocol during fragment matching.\n* [CVE-2017-15377](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15377)\nIt was possible to trigger lots of redundant checks on the content\n of crafted network traffic with a certain signature, because of\n DetectEngineContentInspection in detect-engine-content-inspection.c.\n The search engine doesn't stop when it should after no match is\n found; instead, it stops only upon reaching inspection-recursion limit (3000 by default).\n* [CVE-2018-6794](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6794)\nSuricata is prone to an HTTP detection bypass vulnerability in\n detect.c and stream-tcp.c. If a malicious server breaks a normal\n TCP flow and sends data before the 3-way handshake is complete,\n then the data sent by the malicious server will be accepted by web\n clients such as a web browser or Linux CLI utilities, but ignored\n by Suricata IDS signatures. This mostly affects IDS signatures for\n the HTTP protocol and TCP stream content; signatures for TCP packets\n will inspect such network traffic as usual.\n\n\nTEMP-0856648-2BC2C9 (no CVE assigned yet)\n\n\nOut of bounds read in app-layer-dns-common.c.\n On a zero size A or AAAA record, 4 or 16 bytes would still be read.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.0.7-2+deb8u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your suricata packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
