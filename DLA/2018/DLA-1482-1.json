	"summary": "libx11 - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral issues were discovered in libx11, the client interface to the\nX Windows System. The functions XGetFontPath, XListExtensions, and\nXListFonts are vulnerable to an off-by-one override on malicious\nserver responses. A malicious server could also send a reply in which\nthe first string overflows, causing a variable set to NULL that will\nbe freed later on, leading to a segmentation fault and Denial of\nService. The function XListExtensions in ListExt.c interprets a\nvariable as signed instead of unsigned, resulting in an out-of-bounds\nwrite (of up to 128 bytes), leading to a Denial of Service or possibly\nremote code execution.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2:1.6.2-3+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libx11 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
