	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ISC DHCP client,\nrelay and server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-5732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5732)\nFelix Wilhelm of the Google Security Team discovered that the DHCP\n client is prone to an out-of-bound memory access vulnerability when\n processing specially constructed DHCP options responses, resulting\n in potential execution of arbitrary code by a malicious DHCP server.\n* [CVE-2018-5733](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5733)\nFelix Wilhelm of the Google Security Team discovered that the DHCP\n server does not properly handle reference counting when processing\n client requests. A malicious client can take advantage of this flaw\n to cause a denial of service (dhcpd crash) by sending large amounts\n of traffic.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.2.2.dfsg.1-5+deb70u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
