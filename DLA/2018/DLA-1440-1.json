	"details": "\nThe libarchive-zip-perl package is vulnerable to a directory traversal\nattack in Archive::Zip. It was found that the Archive::Zip module did\nnot properly sanitize paths while extracting zip files. An attacker\nable to provide a specially crafted archive for processing could use\nthis flaw to write or overwrite arbitrary files in the context of the\nPerl interpreter.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.39-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libarchive-zip-perl packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
