Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to\n cause a crash and denial of service via a crafted mng file.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.3.16-1.1+deb7u19.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
