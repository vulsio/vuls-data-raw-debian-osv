Thus an anonymous attacker could\n trigger a denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.3.3.5-4+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your 389-ds-base packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
