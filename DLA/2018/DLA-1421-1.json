	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were found in the interpreter for the Ruby\nlanguage. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-9096](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-9096)\nSMTP command injection in Net::SMTP via CRLF sequences in a RCPT TO\n or MAIL FROM command.\n* [CVE-2016-2339](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2339)\nExploitable heap overflow in Fiddle::Function.new.\n* [CVE-2016-7798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7798)\nIncorrect handling of initialization vector in the GCM mode in the\n OpenSSL extension.\n* [CVE-2017-0898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0898)\nBuffer underrun vulnerability in Kernel.sprintf.\n* [CVE-2017-0899](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0899)\nANSI escape sequence vulnerability in RubyGems.\n* [CVE-2017-0900](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0900)\nDoS vulnerability in the RubyGems query command.\n* [CVE-2017-0901](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0901)\ngem installer allowed a malicious gem to overwrite arbitrary files.\n* [CVE-2017-0902](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0902)\nRubyGems DNS request hijacking vulnerability.\n* [CVE-2017-0903](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0903)\nMax Justicz reported that RubyGems is prone to an unsafe object\n deserialization vulnerability. When parsed by an application which\n processes gems, a specially crafted YAML formatted gem specification\n can lead to remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2017-10784](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10784)\nYusuke Endoh discovered an escape sequence injection vulnerability in\n the Basic authentication of WEBrick. An attacker can take advantage of\n this flaw to inject malicious escape sequences to the WEBrick log and\n potentially execute control characters on the victim's terminal\n emulator when reading logs.\n* [CVE-2017-14033](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14033)\nasac reported a buffer underrun vulnerability in the OpenSSL\n extension. A remote attacker could take advantage of this flaw to\n cause the Ruby interpreter to crash leading to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-14064](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14064)\nHeap memory disclosure in the JSON library.\n* [CVE-2017-17405](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17405)\nA command injection vulnerability in Net::FTP might allow a\n malicious FTP server to execute arbitrary commands.\n* [CVE-2017-17742](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17742)\nAaron Patterson reported that WEBrick bundled with Ruby was vulnerable\n to an HTTP response splitting vulnerability. It was possible for an\n attacker to inject fake HTTP responses if a script accepted an\n external input and output it without modifications.\n* [CVE-2017-17790](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17790)\nA command injection vulnerability in lib/resolv.rb's lazy\\_initialze\n might allow a command injection attack. However untrusted input to\n this function is rather unlikely.\n* [CVE-2018-6914](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6914)\nooooooo\\_q discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in the\n Dir.mktmpdir method in the tmpdir library. It made it possible for\n attackers to create arbitrary directories or files via a .. (dot dot)\n in the prefix argument.\n* [CVE-2018-8777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8777)\nEric Wong reported an out-of-memory DoS vulnerability related to a\n large request in WEBrick bundled with Ruby.\n* [CVE-2018-8778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8778)\naerodudrizzt found a buffer under-read vulnerability in the Ruby\n String#unpack method. If a big number was passed with the specifier @,\n the number was treated as a negative value, and an out-of-buffer read\n occurred. Attackers could read data on heaps if an script accepts an\n external input as the argument of String#unpack.\n* [CVE-2018-8779](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8779)\nooooooo\\_q reported that the UNIXServer.open and UNIXSocket.open\n methods of the socket library bundled with Ruby did not check for NUL\n bytes in the path argument. The lack of check made the methods\n vulnerable to unintentional socket creation and unintentional socket\n access.\n* [CVE-2018-8780](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8780)\nooooooo\\_q discovered an unintentional directory traversal in\n some methods in Dir, by the lack of checking for NUL bytes in their\n parameter.\n* [CVE-2018-1000075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000075)\nA negative size vulnerability in ruby gem package tar header that could\n cause an infinite loop.\n* [CVE-2018-1000076](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000076)\nRubyGems package improperly verifies cryptographic signatures. A mis-signed\n gem could be installed if the tarball contains multiple gem signatures.\n* [CVE-2018-1000077](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000077)\nAn improper input validation vulnerability in RubyGems specification\n homepage attribute could allow malicious gem to set an invalid homepage\n URL.\n* [CVE-2018-1000078](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000078)\nCross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in gem server display of homepage\n attribute.\n* [CVE-2018-1000079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000079)\nPath Traversal vulnerability during gem installation.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.1.5-2+deb8u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.1 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
