	"details": "\nSquid, a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, has been\nfound vulnerable to denial of service attacks associated with ESI\nresponse processing and intermediate CA certificate downloading.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-1000024](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000024)\nIncorrect pointer handling resulted in the ability of a remote\n server to return a crafted ESI response which could trigger a denial\n of service for all clients accessing the Squid service. This issue\n affects the Squid custom ESI parser.\n* [CVE-2018-1000027](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000027)\nIncorrect pointer handling resulted in the possibility of a remote\n client delivering certain HTTP requests in conjunction with certain\n trusted server reponses involving the processing of ESI responses or\n downloading of intermediate CA certificates to trigger a denial of\n service for all clients accessing the squid service.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.1.20-2.2+deb7u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
