	"summary": "firmware-nonfree - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the firmware for\nBroadcom BCM43xx wifi chips that may lead to a privilege escalation\nor loss of confidentiality.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-0801](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0801)\nBroadgate Team discovered flaws in packet processing in the\n Broadcom wifi firmware and proprietary drivers that could lead to\n remote code execution. However, this vulnerability is not\n believed to affect the drivers used in Debian.\n* [CVE-2017-0561](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0561)\nGal Beniamini of Project Zero discovered a flaw in the TDLS\n implementation in Broadcom wifi firmware. This could be exploited\n by an attacker on the same WPA2 network to execute code on the\n wifi microcontroller.\n* [CVE-2017-9417](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9417) /\n #869639\n\n Nitay Artenstein of Exodus Intelligence discovered a flaw in the\n WMM implementation in Broadcom wifi firmware. This could be\n exploited by a nearby attacker to execute code on the wifi\n microcontroller.\n* [CVE-2017-13077](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13077) /\n [CVE-2017-13078](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13078) /\n [CVE-2017-13079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13079) /\n [CVE-2017-13080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13080) /\n [CVE-2017-13081](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13081)\nMathy Vanhoef of the imec-DistriNet research group of KU Leuven\n discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the WPA protocol used for\n authentication in wireless networks, dubbed KRACK.\n\n\nAn attacker exploiting the vulnerabilities could force the\n vulnerable system to reuse cryptographic session keys, enabling a\n range of cryptographic attacks against the ciphers used in WPA1\n and WPA2.\n\n\nThese vulnerabilities are only being fixed for certain Broadcom\n wifi chips, and might still be present in firmware for other wifi\n hardware.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n20161130-4~deb8u1. This version also adds new firmware and packages\nfor use with Linux 4.9, and re-adds firmware-{adi,ralink} as\ntransitional packages.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your firmware-nonfree packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
