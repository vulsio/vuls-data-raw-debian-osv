	"details": "\nMichael Stepankin and Olga Barinova discovered a remote code execution\nvulnerability in Apache Solr by exploiting XML External Entity\nprocessing (XXE) in conjunction with use of a Config API add-listener\ncommand to reach the RunExecutableListener class. To resolve this\nissue the RunExecutableListener class has been removed and resolving\nof external entities in the CoreParser class disallowed.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.6.0+dfsg-1+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lucene-solr packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
