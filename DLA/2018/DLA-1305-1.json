Remote attackers can leverage this\n vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted swf file.\n* [CVE-2018-5294](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5294)\nInteger overflow vulnerability (caused by an out-of-range left shift) in\n the readUInt32 function (util/read.c). Remote attackers could leverage this\n vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted swf file.\n* [CVE-2018-6315](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6315)\nInteger overflow and resultant out-of-bounds read in the\n outputSWF\\_TEXT\\_RECORD function (util/outputscript.c).
