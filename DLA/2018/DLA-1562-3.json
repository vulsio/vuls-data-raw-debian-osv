	"details": "\nVarious security issues were discovered in the poppler PDF rendering\nshared library.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-18267](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18267)\nThe FoFiType1C::cvtGlyph function in fofi/FoFiType1C.cc in Poppler\n through 0.64.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (infinite recursion) via a crafted PDF file, as demonstrated by\n pdftops.\n\n\nThe applied fix in FoFiType1C::cvtGlyph prevents infinite recursion\n on such malformed documents.\n* [CVE-2018-10768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10768)\nA NULL pointer dereference in the AnnotPath::getCoordsLength function\n in Annot.h in Poppler 0.24.5 had been discovered. A crafted input\n will lead to a remote denial of service attack. Later versions of\n Poppler such as 0.41.0 are not affected.\n\n\nThe applied patch fixes the crash on AnnotInk::draw for malformed\n documents.\n* [CVE-2018-13988](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-13988)\nPoppler through 0.62 contains an out of bounds read vulnerability due\n to an incorrect memory access that is not mapped in its memory space,\n as demonstrated by pdfunite. This can result in memory corruption and\n denial of service. This may be exploitable when a victim opens a\n specially crafted PDF file.\n\n\nThe applied patch fixes crashes when Object has negative number.\n (Specs say, number has to be > 0 and gen >= 0).\n\n\nFor Poppler in Debian jessie, the original upstream patch has been\n backported to Poppler's old Object API.\n* [CVE-2018-16646](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16646)\nIn Poppler 0.68.0, the Parser::getObj() function in Parser.cc may\n cause infinite recursion via a crafted file. A remote attacker can\n leverage this for a DoS attack.\n\n\nA range of upstream patches has been applied to Poppler's XRef.cc in\n Debian jessie to consolidate a fix for this issue.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.26.5-2+deb8u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
