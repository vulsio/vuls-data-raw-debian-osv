	"details": "\n* [CVE-2018-10871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10871)\nBy default nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch was set to on. So a copy of\n the unhashed password was kept in modifiers and was possibly logged in\n changelog and retroCL.\n\n\nUnless it is used by some plugin it does not require to keep unhashed\n passwords. The nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch option is now off by\n default.\n* [CVE-2018-10935](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10935)\nIt was discovered that any authenticated user doing a search using\n ldapsearch with extended controls for server side sorting could bring\n down the LDAP server itself.\n\n\nThe fix is to check if we are able to index the provided value. If we\n are not, then slapd\\_qsort returns an error (LDAP\\_OPERATION\\_ERROR).\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.3.3.5-4+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your 389-ds-base packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
