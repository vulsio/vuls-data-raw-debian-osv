	"details": "\nThe linux-base package has been updated to support the package of\nLinux 4.9 that was recently added to Debian 8. This resolves a\ndependency that was not satisfiable by the jessie and jessie-security\nsuites.\n\n\nThis update also fixes a bug in version ordering in the linux-version\ncommand, corrects the package name printed by the perf command when\nlinux-perf-4.9 is needed, and adds bash-completion support for the\nperf command.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, the new version is 4.5~deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-base packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
