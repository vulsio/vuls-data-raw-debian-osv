	"details": "\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the URL-authentication backend of\nthe icecast2, the popular open source streaming media server. If the\nbackend is enabled, then any malicious HTTP client can send a request\nfor specific resource including a crafted header which can overwrite\nthe server's stack contents, leading to denial of service and\npotentially remote code execution.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.4.0-1.1+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your icecast2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
