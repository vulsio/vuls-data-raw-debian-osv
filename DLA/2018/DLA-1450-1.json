	"summary": "tomcat8 - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat\nservlet and JSP engine.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-1304](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1304)\nThe URL pattern of \"\" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the\n context root was not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat when used as\n part of a security constraint definition. This caused the constraint\n to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorized users to\n gain access to web application resources that should have been\n protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty\n string were affected.\n* [CVE-2018-1305](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1305)\nSecurity constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache\n Tomcat were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because\n security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern\n and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the\n order Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be\n applied. This could have exposed resources to users who were not\n authorized to access them.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n8.0.14-1+deb8u12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
