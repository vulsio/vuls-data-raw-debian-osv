The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-14461](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14461)\nAleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos and flxflndy discovered that\n Dovecot does not properly parse invalid email addresses, which may\n cause a crash or leak memory contents to an attacker.\n* [CVE-2017-15130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15130)\nIt was discovered that TLS SNI config lookups may lead to excessive\n memory usage, causing imap-login/pop3-login VSZ limit to be reached\n and the process restarted, resulting in a denial of service. Only\n Dovecot configurations containing local\\_name { } or local { }\n configuration blocks are affected.\n* [CVE-2017-15132](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15132)\nIt was discovered that Dovecot contains a memory leak flaw in the\n login process on aborted SASL authentication.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:2.1.7-7+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
