	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability\nin the nginx web/proxy server.\n\n\nAs there was no validation for the size of a 64-bit atom in an MP4 file,\nthis could have led to a CPU hog when the size was 0, or various other\nproblems due to integer underflow when the calculating atom data size,\nincluding segmentation faults or even worker-process memory disclosure.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this issue has been fixed in nginx version\n1.6.2-5+deb8u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.\n\n\n",
