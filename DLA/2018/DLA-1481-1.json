	"summary": "linux-4.9 - security update",
	"details": "\nMultiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in the way the\nIntel processor designs have implemented speculative execution of\ninstructions in combination with handling of page-faults. This flaw\ncould allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read\nmemory from arbitrary (non-user controlled) addresses, including from\nthe kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross\nguest/host boundaries to read host memory.\n\n\nTo fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install\nupdated CPU microcode (only available in Debian non-free). Common server\nclass CPUs are covered in the update released as DLA 1446-1.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.9.110-3+deb9u4~deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
