	"summary": "firebird2.5 - security update",
	"details": "\nAn authenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary code in Firebird SQL\nServer versions 2.5.7 and 3.0.2 by executing a malformed SQL statement. The\nonly known solution is to disable external UDF libraries from being loaded. In\norder to achieve this, the default configuration has changed to UdfAccess=None.\nThis will prevent the fbudf module from being loaded, but may also break other\nfunctionality relying on modules.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.5.2.26540.ds4-1~deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your firebird2.5 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
