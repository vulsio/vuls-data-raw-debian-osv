	"details": "\nIt was discovered that the emergency logging system in 389-ds-base (the\n389 Directory Server) is affected by a race condition caused by the\ninvalidation of the concurrently used log file file descriptor without\nproper locking. This issue might be triggered by remote attackers to\ncause DoS (crash) and any other undefined behavior.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.3.3.5-4+deb8u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your 389-ds-base packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
