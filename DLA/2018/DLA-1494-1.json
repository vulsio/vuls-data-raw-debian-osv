	"details": "\nThe daemon in GDM does not properly unexport display objects from its\nD-Bus interface when they are destroyed, which allows a local attacker\nto trigger a use-after-free via a specially crafted sequence of D-Bus\nmethod calls, resulting in a denial of service or potential code\nexecution.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.14.1-7+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gdm3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
