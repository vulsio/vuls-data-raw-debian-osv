	"details": "\nTwo security vulnerabilities were discovered in the Z shell.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-1071](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1071)\nStack-based buffer overflow in the exec.c:hashcmd() function.\n A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-1083](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1083)\nBuffer overflow in the shell autocomplete functionality. A local\n unprivileged user can create a specially crafted directory path which\n leads to code execution in the context of the user who tries to use\n autocomplete to traverse the before mentioned path. If the user\n affected is privileged, this leads to privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.3.17-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
