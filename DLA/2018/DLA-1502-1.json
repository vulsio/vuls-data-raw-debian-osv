An attacker could leverage them to insert commands\nvia shell metacharacters in jobs id and have them executed with the\nprivilege of the faxrunq/faxq user.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.1.36-2.1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mgetty packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
