	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-0861](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0861)\nRobb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the ALSA (sound)\n PCM core. We believe this was not possible in practice.\n* [CVE-2017-5715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5715)\nMultiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various\n processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker\n controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary\n addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes\n running on the system.\n\n\nThis specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch\n target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64\n and i386) by using the retpoline compiler feature which allows\n indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.\n* [CVE-2017-13166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13166)\nA bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 ioctl handling\n code has been found. Memory protections ensuring user-provided\n buffers always point to userland memory were disabled, allowing\n destination addresses to be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel\n (amd64 flavour) a local user with access to a suitable video\n device can exploit this to overwrite kernel memory, leading to\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2017-16526](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16526)\nAndrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may dereference\n an invalid pointer in an error case. A local user might be able\n to use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-16911](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16911)\nSecunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci\\_hcd driver exposed\n kernel heap addresses to local users. This information could aid the\n exploitation of other vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2017-16912](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16912)\nSecunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to\n perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading\n to an out-of-bounds read. A remote user able to connect to the\n USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-16913](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16913)\nSecunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to\n perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading\n to excessive memory allocation. A remote user able to connect to\n the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-16914](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16914)\nSecunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to\n check for an invalid combination of fields in a recieved packet,\n leading to a null pointer dereference. A remote user able to\n connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-18017](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18017)\nDenys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter xt\\_TCPMSS module\n failed to validate TCP header lengths, potentially leading to a\n use-after-free. If this module is loaded, it could be used by a\n remote attacker for denial of service or possibly for code\n execution.\n* [CVE-2017-18203](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18203)\nHou Tao reported that there was a race condition in creation and\n deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices. A local user could\n potentially use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-18216](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18216)\nAlex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a\n necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,\n potentially leading to a null pointer dereference. A local user\n could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-1068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1068)\nThe syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of\n ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit\n kernel (amd64 flavour), a local user with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN\n capability could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly\n leading to privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-1092](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1092)\nWen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would\n trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local user able\n to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of\n service.\n* [CVE-2018-5332](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5332)\nMohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not\n sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an out-of-bounds\n write. A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded\n could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-5333](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5333)\nMohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not properly\n handle an error case, leading to a null pointer dereference. A\n local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could\n possibly use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-5750](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5750)\nWang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a kernel heap\n address. This information could aid the exploitation of other\n vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2018-5803](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5803)\nAlexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check\n the length of chunks to be created. A local or remote user could\n use this to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-6927](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6927)\nLi Jinyue reported that the FUTEX\\_REQUEUE operation on futexes did\n not check for negative parameter values, which might lead to a\n denial of service or other security impact.\n* [CVE-2018-7492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7492)\nThe syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was lacking a null\n pointer check. A local attacker on a system with the rds module\n loaded could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-7566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7566)\nčéžéŁ (Fan LongFei) reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)\n sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations. This could\n lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free. A local user\n with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of\n service or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-7740](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7740)\nNic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation\n did not properly range-check the file offset. A local user with\n access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause\n a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-7757](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7757)\nJason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached\n SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a system with SAS devices\n could use this to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-7995](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7995)\nSeunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE\n (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to have\n any security impact.\n* [CVE-2018-8781](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8781)\nEyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap\n operation did not properly range-check the file offset. A local\n user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to\n overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-8822](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8822)\nDr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client\n implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server. An\n ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or\n remote code execution in the client.\n* [CVE-2018-1000004](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000004)\nLuo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound) sequencer\n core, between multiple ioctl operations. This could lead to a\n deadlock or use-after-free. A local user with access to a\n sequencer device could use this for denial of service or possibly\n for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-1000199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000199)\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not\n sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings. Local users\n can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for\n privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other\n architectures.\n\n\nAdditionally, some mitigations for [CVE-2017-5753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5753) \nare included in this release:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-5753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5753)\nMultiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various\n processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker\n controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary\n addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes\n running on the system.\n\n\nThis specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1\n (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable\n code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and\n replacing the array access with the speculation-safe\n array\\_index\\_nospec() function.\n\n\nMore use sites will be added over time.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.2.101-1. This version also includes bug fixes from upstream versions\nup to and including 3.2.101. It also fixes a regression in the\nprocfs hidepid option in the previous version (Debian bug #887106).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
