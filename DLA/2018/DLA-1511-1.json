After user\nconfirmation an additional email with a copy of the report will be\nsent to the debian-lts mailing list.\n\n\nThis change requires two new dependencies, python-requests and python-apt.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n6.6.3+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your reportbug packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
