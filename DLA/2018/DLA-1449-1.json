An attacker with sufficient access to\n mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process\n could recover the private key.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.0.1t-1+deb8u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
