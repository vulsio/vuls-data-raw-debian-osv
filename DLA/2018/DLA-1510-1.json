Buffer overflows and path traversal issues may\nlead to information disclosure, denial-of-service or the execution of\narbitrary code.\n\n\nTo resolve the security vulnerabilities the following limitations were\nmade in GlusterFS:\n\n\n* open,read,write on special files like char and block are no longer\n permitted\n* io-stat xlator can dump stat info only to /run/gluster directory\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.5.2-2+deb8u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your glusterfs packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
