The issue could be triggered if the\n directory part of the URL contained a \"%00\" sequence.\n* [CVE-2018-1000121](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000121)\nDario Weisser reported that curl might dereference a near-NULL address when\n getting an LDAP URL. A malicious server that sends a particularly crafted\n response could made crash applications that allowed LDAP URL relying on\n libcurl.\n* [CVE-2018-1000122](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000122)\nOSS-fuzz and Max Dymond found that curl can be tricked into copying data\n beyond the end of its heap based buffer when asked to transfer an RTSP URL.\n curl could calculate a wrong data length to copy from the read buffer.\n This could lead to information leakage or a denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.26.0-1+wheezy25.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
