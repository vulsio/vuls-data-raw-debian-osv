	"details": "\nSome vulnerabilities were discovered in ghostscript, an interpreter for the\nPostScript language and for PDF.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-19134](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-19134)\nThe setpattern operator did not properly validate certain types. A specially\n crafted PostScript document could exploit this to crash Ghostscript or,\n possibly, execute arbitrary code in the context of the Ghostscript process.\n This is a type confusion issue because of failure to check whether the\n Implementation of a pattern dictionary was a structure type.\n* [CVE-2018-19478](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-19478)\nAttempting to open a carefully crafted PDF file results in long-running\n computation. A sufficiently bad page tree can lead to us taking significant\n amounts of time when checking the tree for recursion.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n9.06~dfsg-2+deb8u13.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
