	"details": "\nTalosintelligence discovered a command injection vulnerability in the\ngplotMakeOutput function of leptonlib. A specially crafted gplot\nrootname argument can cause a command injection resulting in arbitrary\ncode execution. An attacker can provide a malicious path as input to an\napplication that passes attacker data to this function to trigger this\nvulnerability.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.69-3.1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your leptonlib packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
