	"summary": "libssh - security update",
	"details": "\nPeter Winter-Smith of NCC Group discovered that libssh, a tiny C SSH\nlibrary, contains an authentication bypass vulnerability in the server\ncode. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw to successfully\nauthenticate without any credentials by presenting the server an\nSSH2\\_MSG\\_USERAUTH\\_SUCCESS message in place of the\nSSH2\\_MSG\\_USERAUTH\\_REQUEST message which the server would expect to\ninitiate authentication.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.6.3-4+deb8u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
