	"details": "\ndnsmasq, a DNS forwarder and DHCP server, ships the DNS Root Zone Key\nSigning Key (KSK), used as the DNSSEC trust anchor. ICANN will rollover\nthe KSK in 11 October 2018, and DNS resolvers will need the new key\n(KSK-2017) to continue performing DNSSEC validation. This dnsmasq package\nupdate includes the latest key to prevent issues in scenarios where\ndnsmasq runs with DNSSEC enabled and it is using the trusted anchors file\nshipped with the package. Please note this is not the default\nconfiguration in Debian.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.72-3+deb8u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
