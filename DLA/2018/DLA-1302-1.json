This issue\n existed because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2018-3836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-3836).\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.69-3.1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your leptonlib packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
