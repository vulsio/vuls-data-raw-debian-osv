	"details": "\nThe git-annex package was found to have multiple vulnerabilities when\noperating on untrusted data that could lead to arbitrary command\nexecution and encrypted data exfiltration.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-12976](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12976)\ngit-annex before 6.20170818 allows remote attackers to execute\n arbitrary commands via an ssh URL with an initial dash character\n in the hostname, as demonstrated by an ssh://-eProxyCommand= URL,\n a related issue to [CVE-2017-9800](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9800),\n [CVE-2017-12836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12836),\n [CVE-2017-1000116](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000116), and\n [CVE-2017-1000117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000117).\n* [CVE-2018-10857](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10857)\ngit-annex is vulnerable to a private data exposure and\n exfiltration attack. It could expose the content of files located\n outside the git-annex repository, or content from a private web\n server on localhost or the LAN.\n* [CVE-2018-10859](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10859)\ngit-annex is vulnerable to an Information Exposure when decrypting\n files. A malicious server for a special remote could trick\n git-annex into decrypting a file that was encrypted to the user's\n gpg key. This attack could be used to expose encrypted data that\n was never stored in git-annex\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.20141125+oops-1+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your git-annex packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
