	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities have been discovered in php5, a server-side,\nHTML-embedded scripting language. One ([CVE-2018-14851](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14851)) results in a\npotential denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash)\nvia a crafted JPEG file. The other ([CVE-2018-14883](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14883)) is an Integer\nOverflow that leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.\n\n\nAdditionally, a previously introduced patch for [CVE-2017-7272](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7272) was found\nto negatively affect existing PHP applications (#890266). As a result\nof the negative effects and the fact that the security team has marked\nthe CVE in question as \"ignore,\" the patch has been dropped.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.6.37+dfsg-0+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
