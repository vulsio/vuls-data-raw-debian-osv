	"details": "\nDavid Sopas discovered that Kohana, a PHP framework, was vulnerable to\na Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack that allowed remote attackers to\ninject arbitrary web script or HTML by bypassing the strip\\_image\\_tags\nprotection mechanism in system/classes/Kohana/Security.php. This issue\nwas resolved by permanently removing the strip\\_image\\_tags function.\nUsers are advised to sanitize user input by using external libraries\ninstead.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.3.4-2+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libkohana2-php packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
