	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-15710](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15710)\nAlex Nichols and Jakob Hirsch reported that mod\\_authnz\\_ldap, if\n configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, could cause an of bound write\n if supplied with a crafted Accept-Language header. This could\n potentially be used for a Denial of Service attack.\n* [CVE-2018-1301](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1301)\nRobert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted request could have\n crashed the Apache HTTP Server, due to an out of bound access after\n a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header.\n* [CVE-2018-1312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1312)\nNicolas Daniels discovered that when generating an HTTP Digest\n authentication challenge, the nonce sent by mod\\_auth\\_digest to\n prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a\n pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest\n authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across\n servers by an attacker without detection.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.2.22-13+deb7u13.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
