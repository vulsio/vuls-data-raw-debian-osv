	"details": "\nIn RubyGem excon before 0.71.0, there was a race condition around persistent\nconnections, where a connection which is interrupted (such as by a timeout)\nwould leave data on the socket. Subsequent requests would then read this data,\nreturning content from the previous response.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.33.0-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-excon packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
