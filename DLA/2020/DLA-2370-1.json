	"summary": "python-pip - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a directory traversal attack in pip, the\nPython package installer.\n\n\nWhen an URL was given in an install command, as a\nContent-Disposition header was permitted to have ../\ncomponents in their filename, arbitrary local files (eg.\n/root/.ssh/authorized\\_keys) could be overidden.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-20916](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20916)\nThe pip package before 19.2 for Python allows Directory Traversal when a\n URL is given in an install command, because a Content-Disposition header\n can have ../ in a filename, as demonstrated by overwriting the\n /root/.ssh/authorized\\_keys file. This occurs in \\_download\\_http\\_url in\n \\_internal/download.py.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n9.0.1-2+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-pip packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
