	"details": "\nA potential HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in WEBrick\nwas reported.\n\n\nWEBrick (bundled along with jruby) was too tolerant against\nan invalid Transfer-Encoding header. This may lead to\ninconsistent interpretation between WEBrick and some HTTP proxy\nservers, which may allow the attacker to âsmuggleâ a request.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.7.26-1+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jruby packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of jruby please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jruby>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
