	"details": "\nRobert Merget, Marcus Brinkmann, Nimrod Aviram, and Juraj Somorovsky\ndiscovered that certain Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites in the TLS\nspecification and implemented by OpenSSL contained a flaw. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to eavesdrop on encrypted\ncommunications. This was fixed in this update by disabling the insecure\nciphersuites.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.0.2u-1~deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl1.0 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openssl1.0 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssl1.0>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
