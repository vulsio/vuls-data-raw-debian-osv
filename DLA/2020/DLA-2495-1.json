	"summary": "tomcat8 - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Apache Tomcat from 8.5.0 to 8.5.59 could\nre-use an HTTP request header value from the previous stream\nreceived on an HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with\nthe subsequent stream. While this would most likely lead to an\nerror and the closure of the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible\nthat information could leak between requests.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n8.5.54-0+deb9u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of tomcat8 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tomcat8>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
