	],
	"summary": "xrdp - security update",
	"details": "\nxrdp-sesman service in xrdp can be crashed by connecting over port 3350 and\nsupplying a malicious payload. Once the xrdp-sesman process is dead, an\nunprivileged attacker on the server could then proceed to start their own\nimposter sesman service listening on port 3350. This will allow them to capture\nany user credentials that are submitted to XRDP and approve or reject arbitrary\nlogin credentials. For xorgxrdp sessions in particular, this allows an\nunauthorized user to hijack an existing session. This is a buffer overflow\nattack, so there may be a risk of arbitrary code execution as well.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.9.1-9+deb9u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xrdp packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of xrdp please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xrdp>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
