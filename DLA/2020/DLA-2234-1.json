A local attacker can\n test for the existence of files and directories anywhere in\n the filesystem because qmail-verify runs as root and tests\n for the existence of files in the attacker's home directory,\n without dropping its privileges first.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.06-6.2~deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your netqmail packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
