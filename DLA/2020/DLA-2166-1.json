	"summary": "libpam-krb5 - security update",
	"details": "\nThe krb5 PAM module (pam\\_krb5.so) had a buffer overflow that might have\ncaused remote code execution in situations involving supplemental\nprompting by a Kerberos library. It might have overflown a buffer\nprovided by the underlying Kerberos library by a single '\\0' byte if an\nattacker responded to a prompt with an answer of a carefully chosen\nlength. The effect may have ranged from heap corruption to stack\ncorruption depending on the structure of the underlying Kerberos library,\nwith unknown effects but possibly including code execution. This code\npath had not been used for normal authentication, but only when the\nKerberos library did supplemental prompting, such as with PKINIT or when\nusing the non-standard no\\_prompt PAM configuration option.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n4.6-3+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpam-krb5 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
