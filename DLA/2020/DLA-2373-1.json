	"details": "\nThe following security issues have been found in qemu, which could\npotentially result in DoS and execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-1711](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1711)\nAn out-of-bounds heap buffer access flaw was found in the way the iSCSI\n Block driver in QEMU handled a response coming from an iSCSI server\n while checking the status of a Logical Address Block (LBA) in an\n iscsi\\_co\\_block\\_status() routine. A remote user could use this flaw to\n crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service or potential\n execution of arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process on the\n host.\n* [CVE-2020-13253](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13253)\nAn out-of-bounds read access issue was found in the SD Memory Card\n emulator of the QEMU. It occurs while performing block write commands\n via sdhci\\_write(), if a guest user has sent address which is OOB of\n 's->wp\\_groups'. A guest user/process may use this flaw to crash the\n QEMU process resulting in DoS.\n* [CVE-2020-14364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-14364)\nAn out-of-bounds read/write access issue was found in the USB emulator\n of the QEMU. It occurs while processing USB packets from a guest, when\n 'USBDevice->setup\\_len' exceeds the USBDevice->data\\_buf[4096], in\n do\\_token\\_{in,out} routines.\n* [CVE-2020-16092](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-16092)\nAn assertion failure can occur in the network packet processing. This\n issue affects the e1000e and vmxnet3 network devices. A malicious guest\n user/process could use this flaw to abort the QEMU process on the host,\n resulting in a denial of service condition in\n net\\_tx\\_pkt\\_add\\_raw\\_fragment in hw/net/net\\_tx\\_pkt.c\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of qemu please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/qemu>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
