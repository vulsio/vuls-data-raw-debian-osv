Session management does not use a sufficiently\n hard-to-guess session key. Anyone who can guess the microsecond\n time (and the incrementing session\\_id) can impersonate a session.\n* [CVE-2020-11729](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11729)\nAn issue was discovered in DAViCal Andrew's Web Libraries (AWL)\n through 0.60. Long-term session cookies, uses to provide\n long-term session continuity, are not generated securely, enabling\n a brute-force attack that may be successful.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.55-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your awl packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
