For more details see the upstream advisory:\n <https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-012>\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.52-2+deb9u12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of drupal7 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/drupal7>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
