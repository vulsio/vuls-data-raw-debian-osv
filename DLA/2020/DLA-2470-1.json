Off-by-one errors, wrong parsing of shebang lines\nand buffer overflows may lead to unexpected behavior. A local, unprivileged\nuser can create a specially crafted message file or directory path. If the\nreceiving user is privileged or traverses the aforementioned path, this leads\nto privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.3.1-4+deb9u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of zsh please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zsh>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
