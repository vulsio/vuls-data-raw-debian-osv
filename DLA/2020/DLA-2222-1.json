	"details": "\nVarious minor vulnerabilities have been addredd in libexif, a library to\nparse EXIF metadata files.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-20030](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20030)\nThis issue had already been addressed via DLA-2214-1. However, upstream\n provided an updated patch, so this has been followed up on.\n* [CVE-2020-13112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13112)\nSeveral buffer over-reads in EXIF MakerNote handling could have lead\n to information disclosure and crashes. This issue is different from\n already resolved [CVE-2020-0093](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0093).\n* [CVE-2020-13113](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13113)\nUse of uninitialized memory in EXIF Makernote handling could have\n lead to crashes and potential use-after-free conditions.\n* [CVE-2020-13114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13114)\nAn unrestricted size in handling Canon EXIF MakerNote data could have\n lead to consumption of large amounts of compute time for decoding\n EXIF data.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.6.21-2+deb8u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libexif packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
