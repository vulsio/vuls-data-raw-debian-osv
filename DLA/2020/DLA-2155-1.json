	"summary": "tomcat8 - security update",
	"details": "\nTomcat8 is configured with the JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener, a local\nattacker without access to the Tomcat process or configuration files\nis able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle\nattack to capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX\ninterface. The attacker can then use these credentials to access the\nJMX interface and gain complete control over the Tomcat instance.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n8.0.14-1+deb8u16.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
