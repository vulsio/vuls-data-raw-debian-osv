	"summary": "xawtv - security update",
	"details": "\nAn issue was discovered in LinuxTV xawtv before 3.107. The function\ndev\\_open() in v4l-conf.c does not perform sufficient checks to\nprevent an unprivileged caller of the program from opening unintended\nfilesystem paths. This allows a local attacker with access to the\nv4l-conf setuid-root program to test for the existence of arbitrary\nfiles and to trigger an open on arbitrary files with mode O\\_RDWR.\nTo achieve this, relative path components need to be added to the\ndevice path, as demonstrated by a\nv4l-conf -c /dev/../root/.bash\\_history command.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.103-3+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xawtv packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
