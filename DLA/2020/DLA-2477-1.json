	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an issue in the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) interactive notebook system where a\nmaliciously-crafted link could redirect the browser to a malicious/spoofed\nwebsite.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-26215](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26215)\nJupyter Notebook before version 6.1.5 has an Open redirect\n vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to a notebook server could\n redirect the browser to a different website. All notebook servers are\n technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be\n reasonably made for known notebook server hosts. A link to your notebook\n server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the\n public internet. The issue is patched in version 6.1.5.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.2.3-4+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jupyter-notebook packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
