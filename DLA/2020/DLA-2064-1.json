	"details": "\nIt was discovered that a hook script of ldm, the display manager for the\nLinux Terminal Server Project incorrectly parsed responses from an SSH server\nwhich could result in local root privilege escalation.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-20373](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20373)\nLTSP LDM through 2.18.06 allows fat-client root access because the\n LDM\\_USERNAME variable may have an empty value if the user's shell\n lacks support for Bourne shell syntax. This is related to a\n run-x-session script.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2:2.2.15-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ldm packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
