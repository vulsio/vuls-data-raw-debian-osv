	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information\nleak.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-2215](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-2215)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in\n the Android binder driver. A local user on a system with this\n driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\n corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.\n* [CVE-2019-10220](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10220)\nVarious developers and researchers found that if a crafted\n file-system or malicious file server presented a directory with\n filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and\n possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the\n directory.\n\n\nThe kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,\n rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.\n* [CVE-2019-14895](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14895), [CVE-2019-14901](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14901)\nADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in\n the mwifiex wifi driver. On systems using this driver, a\n malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these\n to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or\n possibly for remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2019-14896](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14896), [CVE-2019-14897](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14897)\nADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer\n overflows in the libertas wifi driver. On systems using this\n driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could\n use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or\n crash) or possibly for remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2019-15098](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15098)\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer reported that the ath6kl wifi driver\n did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead to a\n null pointer derefernce. An attacker able to add USB devices\n could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).\n* [CVE-2019-15217](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15217)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered that the zr364xx mdia driver did not\n correctly handle devices without a product name string, which\n could lead to a null pointer dereference. An attacker able to add\n USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service\n (BUG/oops).\n* [CVE-2019-15291](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15291)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered that the b2c2-flexcop-usb media\n driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead\n to a null pointer dereference. An attacker able to add USB\n devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).\n* [CVE-2019-15505](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15505)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver\n did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to\n a heap buffer over-read. An attacker able to add USB devices\n could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read\n sensitive information from kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2019-16746](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16746)\nIt was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content\n of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface\n in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.\n A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use\n this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-17052](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17052), [CVE-2019-17053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17053), [CVE-2019-17054](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17054), [CVE-2019-17055](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17055), [CVE-2019-17056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17056)\nOri Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations\n - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all\n users to create raw sockets. A local user could use this to send\n arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.\n* [CVE-2019-17133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17133)\nNicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate\n received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a\n buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.\n A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to\n cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for\n remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2019-17666](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17666)\nNicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not\n properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer\n overflow. A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial\n of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code\n execution.\n* [CVE-2019-19051](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19051)\nNavid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the i2400m\n wimax driver if the software rfkill operation fails.

The security impact of\n this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2019-19062](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19062)\nNavid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the AF\\_ALG\n subsystem if the CRYPTO\\_MSG\\_GETALG operation fails. A local user\n could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory\n exhaustion).\n* [CVE-2019-19066](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19066)\nNavid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the bfa SCSI\n driver if the get\\_fc\\_host\\_stats operation fails. The security\n impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2019-19227](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19227)\nDan Carpenter reported missing error checks in the Appletalk\n protocol implementation that could lead to a null pointer\n dereference. The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2019-19332](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19332)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered a missing bounds check in the KVM\n implementation for x86, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.\n A local user permitted to use KVM could use this to cause a denial\n of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-19523](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19523)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free bug in the adutux\n USB driver. An attacker able to add and remove USB devices could\n use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash)\n or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-19524](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19524)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered a race condition in the ff-memless\n library used by input drivers.
