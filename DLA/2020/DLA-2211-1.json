	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an XML external entity vulnerability in\nlog4net, a logging API for the ECMA Common Language Infrastructure\n(CLI), sometimes referred to as \"Mono\".\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-1285](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1285)\nApache log4net before 2.0.8 does not disable XML external entities when parsing log4net configuration files. This could allow for XXE-based attacks in applications that accept arbitrary configuration files from users.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.2.10+dfsg-6+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your log4net packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
