	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an issue in the sddm display manager\nwhere local unprivileged users could create a connection to the X\nserver.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-28049](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-28049)\nAn issue was discovered in SDDM before 0.19.0. It incorrectly starts the\n X server in a way that - for a short time period - allows local\n unprivileged users to create a connection to the X server without providing\n proper authentication. A local attacker can thus access X server display\n contents and, for example, intercept keystrokes or access the clipboard.\n This is caused by a race condition during Xauthority file\n creation.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.14.0-4+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sddm packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
