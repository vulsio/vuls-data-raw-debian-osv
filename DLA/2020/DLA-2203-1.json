	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a denial of service attack in the SQLite\ndatabase, often embedded into other programs and servers.\n\n\nIn the event of a semantic error in an aggregate query, SQLite did not\nreturn early from the \"resetAccumulator()\" function which would lead to a crash\nvia a segmentation fault.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-11655](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11655)\nSQLite through 3.31.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service\n (segmentation fault) via a malformed window-function query because the\n AggInfo object's initialization is mishandled.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.8.7.1-1+deb8u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sqlite3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
