	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in jupyter-notebook.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-8768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8768)\nA maliciously forged notebook file can bypass sanitization to execute\n Javascript in the notebook context. Specifically, invalid HTML is\n fixed by jQuery after sanitization, making it dangerous.\n* [CVE-2018-19351](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-19351)\nallows XSS via an untrusted notebook because nbconvert responses are\n considered to have the same origin as the notebook server.\n* [CVE-2018-21030](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-21030)\njupyter-notebook does not use a CSP header to treat served files as\n belonging to a separate origin. Thus, for example, an XSS payload can\n be placed in an SVG document.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.2.3-4+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jupyter-notebook packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of jupyter-notebook please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jupyter-notebook>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
