	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in netty, a Java NIO\nclient/server socket framework.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-20444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20444)\nHttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows an HTTP header\n that lacks a colon, which might be interpreted as a separate header\n with an incorrect syntax, or might be interpreted as an \"invalid\n fold.\"\n* [CVE-2019-20445](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20445)\nHttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows a Content-Length\n header to be accompanied by a second Content-Length header, or by a\n Transfer-Encoding header.\n* [CVE-2020-7238](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-7238)\nNetty 4.1.43.Final allows HTTP Request Smuggling because it\n mishandles Transfer-Encoding whitespace (such as a\n [space]Transfer-Encoding:chunked line) and a later Content-Length\n header. This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for\n [CVE-2019-16869](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16869).\n* [CVE-2020-11612](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11612)\nThe ZlibDecoders in Netty 4.1.x before 4.1.46 allow for unbounded\n memory allocation while decoding a ZlibEncoded byte stream. An\n attacker could send a large ZlibEncoded byte stream to the Netty\n server, forcing the server to allocate all of its free memory to a\n single decoder.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:4.1.7-2+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your netty packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of netty please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/netty>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
