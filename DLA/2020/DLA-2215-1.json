The vulnerability is due to a heap buffer overflow read.\n An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted\n ARJ file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the\n attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process crash, resulting\n in a denial of service condition.\n* [CVE-2020-3341](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-3341)\nA vulnerability in the PDF archive parsing module in Clam\n AntiVirus (ClamAV) could allow an unauthenticated, remote\n attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected\n device. The vulnerability is due to a stack buffer overflow read.\n An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted\n PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the\n attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process crash, resulting\n in a denial of service condition.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.101.5+dfsg-0+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
