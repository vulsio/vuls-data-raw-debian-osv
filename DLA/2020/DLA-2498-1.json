	"summary": "xerces-c - security update",
	"details": "\nThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) discovered that\nXerces-C, a validating XML parser library for C++, contains a\nuse-after-free error triggered during the scanning of external\nDTDs. An attacker could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly\nachieve remote code execution. This flaw has not been addressed in the\nmaintained version of the library and has no complete mitigation. The\nfirst is provided by this update which fixes the use-after-free\nvulnerability at the expense of a memory leak. The other is to disable\nDTD processing, which can be accomplished via the DOM using a standard\nparser feature, or via SAX using the XERCES\\_DISABLE\\_DTD environment\nvariable.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.1.4+debian-2+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xerces-c packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of xerces-c please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xerces-c>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
