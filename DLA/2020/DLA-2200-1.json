	"summary": "mailman - security update",
	"details": "\nA vulnerability was discovered in mailman. GNU Mailman 2.x before 2.1.30\nuses the .obj extension for scrubbed application/octet-stream MIME parts.\nThis behavior may contribute to XSS attacks against list-archive visitors,\nbecause an HTTP reply from an archive web server may lack a MIME type,\nand a web browser may perform MIME sniffing, conclude that the MIME type\nshould have been text/html, and execute JavaScript code.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:2.1.18-2+deb8u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
