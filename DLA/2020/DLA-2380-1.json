To mitigate, json\\_dumper.rb in gon now does\n escaping for XSS by default without relying on MultiJson.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n6.1.0-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-gon packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
