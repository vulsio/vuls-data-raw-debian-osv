	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a popular\ncontent management framework.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-17670](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17670)\nWordPress has a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability\n because Windows paths are mishandled during certain validation of\n relative URLs.\n* [CVE-2020-4047](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4047)\nAuthenticated users with upload permissions (like authors) are\n able to inject JavaScript into some media file attachment pages in\n a certain way. This can lead to script execution in the context of\n a higher privileged user when the file is viewed by them.\n* [CVE-2020-4048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4048)\nDue to an issue in wp\\_validate\\_redirect() and URL sanitization, an\n arbitrary external link can be crafted leading to unintended/open\n redirect when clicked.\n* [CVE-2020-4049](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4049)\nWhen uploading themes, the name of the theme folder can be crafted\n in a way that could lead to JavaScript execution in /wp-admin on\n the themes page.\n* [CVE-2020-4050](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4050)\nMisuse of the `set-screen-option` filter's return value allows\n arbitrary user meta fields to be saved. It does require an admin\n to install a plugin that would misuse the filter. Once installed,\n it can be leveraged by low privileged users.\n\n\nAdditionally, this upload ensures latest comments can only be viewed\nfrom public posts, and fixes back the user activation procedure.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.7.18+dfsg-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wordpress>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
