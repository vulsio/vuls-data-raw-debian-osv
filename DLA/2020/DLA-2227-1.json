	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server\nimplementation.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-8616](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8616)\nIt was discovered that BIND does not sufficiently limit the number\n of fetches performed when processing referrals. An attacker can take\n advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (performance\n degradation) or use the recursing server in a reflection attack with\n a high amplification factor.\n* [CVE-2020-8617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8617)\nIt was discovered that a logic error in the code which checks TSIG\n validity can be used to trigger an assertion failure, resulting in\n denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u19.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
