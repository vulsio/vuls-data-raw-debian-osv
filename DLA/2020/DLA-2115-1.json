This triggers a use-after-free in\n alloc\\_pool in pool.c, and possible remote code\n execution.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.3.5e+r1.3.5-2+deb8u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
