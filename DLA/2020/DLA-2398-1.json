	"summary": "puma - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in puma, highly\nconcurrent HTTP server for Ruby/Rack applications.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-11076](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11076)\nBy using an invalid transfer-encoding header, an attacker could smuggle\n an HTTP response.\n* [CVE-2020-11077](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11077)\nclient could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to\n send a response back to another unknown client. If the proxy uses\n persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP\n pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma,\n however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second\n request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the\n proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another\n request for a different client, the second response from the first\n client will be sent to the second client.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.6.0-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your puma packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of puma please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/puma>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
