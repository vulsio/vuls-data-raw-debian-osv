	"details": "\nTwo security vulnerabilities have been fixed in the Tomcat\nservlet and JSP engine.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-12418](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12418)\nWhen Apache Tomcat is configured with the JMX Remote Lifecycle\n Listener, a local attacker without access to the Tomcat process\n or configuration files is able to manipulate the RMI registry to\n perform a man-in-the-middle attack to capture user names and\n passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can\n then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and gain\n complete control over the Tomcat instance.\n* [CVE-2019-17563](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17563)\nWhen using FORM authentication with Apache Tomcat there was a\n narrow window where an attacker could perform a session fixation\n attack. The window was considered too narrow for an exploit to\n be practical but, erring on the side of caution, this issue has\n been treated as a security vulnerability.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.0.56-3+really7.0.99-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
