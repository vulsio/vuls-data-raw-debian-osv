The license key could be obtained by simple observation of the\nprocess list when a data upload is being performed.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-13033](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13033)\nIn CISOfy Lynis 2.x through 2.7.5, the license key can be obtained by\n looking at the process list when a data upload is being performed. This\n license can be used to upload data to a central Lynis server. Although no\n data can be extracted by knowing the license key, it may be possible to\n upload the data of additional scans.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.6.3-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lynis packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
