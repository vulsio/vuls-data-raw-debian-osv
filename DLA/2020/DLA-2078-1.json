A malicious XML-RPC server could target\na XML-RPC client causing it to execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nClients that expect to get server-side exceptions need to set the\nenabledForExceptions property to true in order to process serialized\nexception messages again.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.1.3-7+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxmlrpc3-java packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
