	"details": "\nMultiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in the QUIC\nimage decoding process of the SPICE remote display system.\n\n\nBoth the SPICE client (spice-gtk) and server are affected by\nthese flaws. These flaws allow a malicious client or server to\nsend specially crafted messages that, when processed by the\nQUIC image compression algorithm, result in a process crash or\npotential code execution.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.33-3.3+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your spice-gtk packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of spice-gtk please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/spice-gtk>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
