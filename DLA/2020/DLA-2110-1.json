	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Netty, a Java NIO\nclient/server socket framework:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-0193](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0193)\nWebSocket08FrameDecoder allows remote attackers to cause a denial\n of service (memory consumption) via a TextWebSocketFrame followed\n by a long stream of ContinuationWebSocketFrames.\n* [CVE-2014-3488](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3488)\nThe SslHandler allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a crafted\n SSLv2Hello message.\n* [CVE-2019-16869](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16869)\nNetty mishandles whitespace before the colon in HTTP headers (such\n as a \"Transfer-Encoding : chunked\" line), which leads to HTTP\n request smuggling.\n* [CVE-2019-20444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20444)\nHttpObjectDecoder.java allows an HTTP header that lacks a colon,\n which might be interpreted as a separate header with an incorrect\n syntax, or might be interpreted as an \"invalid fold.\"\n* [CVE-2019-20445](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20445)\nHttpObjectDecoder.java allows a Content-Length header to be\n accompanied by a second Content-Length header, or by a\n Transfer-Encoding header.\n* [CVE-2020-7238](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-7238)\nNetty allows HTTP Request Smuggling because it mishandles\n Transfer-Encoding whitespace (such as a\n [space]Transfer-Encoding:chunked line) and a later Content-Length\n header.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.9.0.Final-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your netty-3.9 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
