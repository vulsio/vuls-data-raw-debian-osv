When a server had sent a begin TLS response, the client read\n additional data (e.g., from a man-in-the-middle attacker) and\n evaluated it in a TLS context, aka \"response injection.\"\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.5.23-3+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mutt packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
