	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web\nblogging tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform\nvarious Cross-Side Scripting (XSS) attacks, create open\nredirects, escalate privileges, and bypass authorization\naccess.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-4046](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4046)\nIn affected versions of WordPress, users with low\n privileges (like contributors and authors) can use the\n embed block in a certain way to inject unfiltered HTML\n in the block editor. When affected posts are viewed by a\n higher privileged user, this could lead to script\n execution in the editor/wp-admin.\n* [CVE-2020-4047](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4047)\nIn affected versions of WordPress, authenticated users with\n upload permissions (like authors) are able to inject\n JavaScript into some media file attachment pages in a certain\n way. This can lead to script execution in the context of a\n higher privileged user when the file is viewed by them.\n* [CVE-2020-4048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4048)\nIn affected versions of WordPress, due to an issue in\n wp\\_validate\\_redirect() and URL sanitization, an arbitrary\n external link can be crafted leading to unintended/open\n redirect when clicked.\n* [CVE-2020-4049](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4049)\nIn affected versions of WordPress, when uploading themes, the\n name of the theme folder can be crafted in a way that could\n lead to JavaScript execution in /wp-admin on the themes page.\n This does require an admin to upload the theme, and is low\n severity self-XSS.\n* [CVE-2020-4050](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4050)\nIn affected versions of WordPress, misuse of the\n `set-screen-option` filter's return value allows arbitrary\n user meta fields to be saved. It does require an admin to\n install a plugin that would misuse the filter. Once installed,\n it can be leveraged by low privileged users.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.1.31+dfsg-0+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
