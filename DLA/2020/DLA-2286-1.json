	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat\nservlet and JSP engine.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-13934](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13934)\nAn h2c direct connection to Apache Tomcat did not release the\n HTTP/1.1 processor after the upgrade to HTTP/2. If a sufficient\n number of such requests were made, an OutOfMemoryException could\n occur leading to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2020-13935](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13935)\nThe payload length in a WebSocket frame was not correctly validated\n in Apache Tomcat. Invalid payload lengths could trigger an infinite\n loop. Multiple requests with invalid payload lengths could lead to a\n denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n8.5.54-0+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of tomcat8 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tomcat8>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
