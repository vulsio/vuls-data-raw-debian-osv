	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an escaping issue in\nlibphp-phpmailer, an email generation utility class for the PHP\nprogramming language.\n\n\nThe Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers could have\npermitted file attachments that bypassed attachment filters which\nmatch on filename extensions. For more information, please see the\n[upstream announcement](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/security/advisories/GHSA-f7hx-fqxw-rvvj)\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-13625](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13625)\nPHPMailer before 6.1.6 contains an output escaping bug when the name of\n a file attachment contains a double quote character. This can result in the\n file type being misinterpreted by the receiver or any mail relay processing\n the message.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.2.9+dfsg-2+deb8u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libphp-phpmailer packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
