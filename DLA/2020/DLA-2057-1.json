	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there were three vulnerabilities in Pillow, an\nimaging library for the Python programming language\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-19911](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19911)\nThere is a DoS vulnerability in Pillow before 6.2.2 caused by\n FpxImagePlugin.py calling the range function on an unvalidated 32-bit\n integer if the number of bands is large. On Windows running 32-bit Python,\n this results in an OverflowError or MemoryError due to the 2 GB limit.\n However, on Linux running 64-bit Python this results in the process being\n terminated by the OOM killer.\n* [CVE-2020-5312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-5312)\nlibImaging/PcxDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has a PCX P mode buffer\n overflow.\n* [CVE-2020-5313](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-5312)\nlibImaging/FliDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has an FLI buffer\n overflow.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.6.1-2+deb8u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pillow packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
