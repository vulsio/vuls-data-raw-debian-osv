	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities were discovered in XStream, a Java library to\nserialize objects to XML and back again.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-26258](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26258)\nXStream is vulnerable to a Server-Side Forgery Request which can be\n activated when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker\n to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available\n only by manipulating the processed input stream.\n* [CVE-2020-26259](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26259)\nXstream is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion on the local host when\n unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to delete\n arbitrary known files on the host as long as the executing process has\n sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.4.11.1-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxstream-java packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libxstream-java please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxstream-java>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
