	"details": "\nA privilege escalation was discovered in Sympa, a modern mailing list\nmanager. It is fixed when Sympa is used in conjunction with common\nMTAs (such as Exim or Postfix) by disabling a setuid executable,\nalthough no fix is currently available for all environments (such as\nsendmail). Additionally, an open-redirect vulnerability was\ndiscovered and fixed.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-26880](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26880)\nSympa allows a local privilege escalation from the sympa user\n account to full root access by modifying the sympa.conf\n configuration file (which is owned by sympa) and parsing it\n through the setuid sympa\\_newaliases-wrapper executable.\n* [CVE-2018-1000671](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000671)\nSympa contains a CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open\n Redirect') vulnerability in The referer parameter of the\n wwsympa.fcgi login action. that can result in Open redirection and\n reflected XSS via data URIs.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n6.2.16~dfsg-3+deb9u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sympa packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of sympa please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sympa>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
