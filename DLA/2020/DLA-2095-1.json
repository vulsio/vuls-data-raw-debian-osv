	"summary": "storebackup - security update",
	"details": "\nstoreBackup.pl in storeBackup through 3.5 relies on the /tmp/storeBackup.lock\npathname, which allows symlink attacks that possibly lead to privilege\nescalation.\n\n\nLocal users can also create a plain file named /tmp/storeBackup.lock to block\nuse of storeBackup until an admin manually deletes that file.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.2.1-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your storebackup packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
