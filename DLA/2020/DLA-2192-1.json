	"summary": "ruby2.1 - security update",
	"details": "\nThe JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.1 has an\nunsafe object creation vulnerability.\nThis is quite similar to [CVE-2013-0269](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0269), but does not rely on poor\ngarbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON\nparsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within\nthe interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.1.5-2+deb8u10.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.1 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
