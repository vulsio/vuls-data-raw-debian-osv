	"summary": "php7.0 - security update",
	"details": "\nA vulnerability was discovered in PHP, a server-side, HTML-embedded\nscripting language. When PHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values,\nthe cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead to cookies with prefixes\nlike \\_\\_Host confused with cookies that decode to such prefix, thus\nleading to an attacker being able to forge a cookie which is supposed to\nbe secure.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n7.0.33-0+deb9u10.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php7.0 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of php7.0 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/php7.0>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
