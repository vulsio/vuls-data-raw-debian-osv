	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in salt.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-16846](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-16846)\nAn unauthenticated user with network access to the Salt API can use\n shell injections to run code on the Salt-API using the SSH client\n* [CVE-2020-17490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17490)\nWhen using the functions create\\_ca, create\\_csr, and\n create\\_self\\_signed\\_cert in the tls execution module, it would not\n ensure the key was created with the correct permissions.\n* [CVE-2020-25592](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25592)\nProperly validate eauth credentials and tokens along with their Access\n Control Lists â ACLs. Prior to this change, eauth was not properly\n validated when calling Salt SSH via the salt-api. Any value for âeauthâ\n or âtokenâ would allow a user to bypass authentication and make calls\n to Salt SSH\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2016.11.2+ds-1+deb9u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your salt packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of salt please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/salt>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
