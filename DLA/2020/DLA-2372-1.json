	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a denial of service attack in libproxy, a\nlibrary to make applications HTTP proxy aware. A remote server could cause an\ninfinite stack recursion.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-25219](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25219)\nurl::recvline in url.cpp in libproxy 0.4.x through 0.4.15 allows a\n remote HTTP server to trigger uncontrolled recursion via a response\n composed of an infinite stream that lacks a newline character. This leads\n to stack exhaustion.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.4.14-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libproxy packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
