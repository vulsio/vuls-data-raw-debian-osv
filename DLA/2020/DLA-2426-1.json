	],
	"summary": "junit4 - security update",
	"details": "\nIn junit4 the test rule TemporaryFolder contains a local information disclosure vulnerability. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts you if the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder, and the JUnit tests execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n4.12-4+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your junit4 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of junit4 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/junit4>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
