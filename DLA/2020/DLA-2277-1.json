	"details": "\nThe following CVEs were reported against src:openjpeg2.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-12973](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12973)\nIn OpenJPEG 2.3.1, there is excessive iteration in the\n opj\\_t1\\_encode\\_cblks function of openjp2/t1.c. Remote attackers\n could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service\n via a crafted bmp file. This issue is similar to [CVE-2018-6616](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6616).\n* [CVE-2020-6851](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-6851)\nOpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a heap-based buffer overflow in\n opj\\_t1\\_clbl\\_decode\\_processor in openjp2/t1.c because of lack\n of opj\\_j2k\\_update\\_image\\_dimensions validation.\n* [CVE-2020-8112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8112)\nopj\\_t1\\_clbl\\_decode\\_processor in openjp2/t1.c in OpenJPEG 2.3.1\n through 2020-01-28 has a heap-based buffer overflow in the\n qmfbid==1 case, a different issue than [CVE-2020-6851](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-6851).\n* [CVE-2020-15389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-15389)\njp2/opj\\_decompress.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a\n use-after-free that can be triggered if there is a mix of\n valid and invalid files in a directory operated on by the\n decompressor. Triggering a double-free may also be possible.\n This is related to calling opj\\_image\\_destroy twice.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.1.2-1.1+deb9u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openjpeg2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openjpeg2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openjpeg2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
