	"details": "\nTim Starling discovered two vulnerabilities in firejail, a sandbox\nprogram to restrict the running environment of untrusted applications.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-17367](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17367)\nIt was reported that firejail does not respect the end-of-options\n separator (\"--\"), allowing an attacker with control over the command\n line options of the sandboxed application, to write data to a\n specified file.\n* [CVE-2020-17368](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17368)\nIt was reported that firejail when redirecting output via --output\n or --output-stderr, concatenates all command line arguments into a\n single string that is passed to a shell. An attacker who has control\n over the command line arguments of the sandboxed application could\n take advantage of this flaw to run run arbitrary other commands.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.9.44.8-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your firejail packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of firejail please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/firejail>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
