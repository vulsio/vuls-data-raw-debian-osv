	"details": "\nThe http2 server support in this package was vulnerable to\ncertain types of DOS attacks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-9512](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9512)\nThis code was vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of\n service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer\n to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data\n is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.\n* [CVE-2019-9514](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9514)\nThis code was vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial\n of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request\n over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST\\_STREAM frames from the\n peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST\\_STREAM frames, this can consume\n excess memory, CPU, or both.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:0.0+git20161013.8b4af36+dfsg-3+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your golang-golang-x-net-dev packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of golang-golang-x-net-dev please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-golang-x-net-dev>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
