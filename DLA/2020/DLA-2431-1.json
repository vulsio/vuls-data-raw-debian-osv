	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the Oniguruma regular\nexpressions library, notably used in PHP mbstring.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-13224](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13224)\nA use-after-free in onig\\_new\\_deluxe() in regext.c allows\n attackers to potentially cause information disclosure, denial of\n service, or possibly code execution by providing a crafted regular\n expression. The attacker provides a pair of a regex pattern and a\n string, with a multi-byte encoding that gets handled by\n onig\\_new\\_deluxe().\n* [CVE-2019-16163](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16163)\nOniguruma allows Stack Exhaustion in regcomp.c because of recursion\n in regparse.c.\n* [CVE-2019-19012](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19012)\nAn integer overflow in the search\\_in\\_range function in regexec.c in\n Onigurama leads to an out-of-bounds read, in which the offset of\n this read is under the control of an attacker. (This only affects\n the 32-bit compiled version). Remote attackers can cause a\n denial-of-service or information disclosure, or possibly have\n unspecified other impact, via a crafted regular expression.\n* [CVE-2019-19203](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19203)\nAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma. In the function\n gb18030\\_mbc\\_enc\\_len in file gb18030.c, a UChar pointer is\n dereferenced without checking if it passed the end of the matched\n string. This leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.\n* [CVE-2019-19204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19204)\nAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma. In the function\n fetch\\_interval\\_quantifier (formerly known as fetch\\_range\\_quantifier)\n in regparse.c, PFETCH is called without checking PEND. This leads to\n a heap-based buffer over-read.\n* [CVE-2019-19246](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19246)\nOniguruma has a heap-based buffer over-read in str\\_lower\\_case\\_match\n in regexec.c.\n* [CVE-2020-26159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26159)\nIn Oniguruma an attacker able to supply a regular expression for\n compilation may be able to overflow a buffer by one byte in\n concat\\_opt\\_exact\\_str in src/regcomp.c\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n6.1.3-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libonig packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libonig please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libonig>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
