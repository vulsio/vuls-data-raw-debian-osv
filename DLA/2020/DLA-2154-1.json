The\n attack can be performed if a user attempts certain search\n operations on the malicious database or table.\n* [CVE-2020-10803](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10803)\nIn phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.9.5, a SQL injection vulnerability\n was discovered where malicious code could be used to trigger\n an XSS attack through retrieving and displaying results (in\n tbl\\_get\\_field.php and libraries/classes/Display/Results.php).\n The attacker must be able to insert crafted data into certain\n database tables, which when retrieved (for instance, through the\n Browse tab) can trigger the XSS attack.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n4:4.2.12-2+deb8u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
