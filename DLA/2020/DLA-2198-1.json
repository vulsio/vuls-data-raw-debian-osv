	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in otrs2 (Open source Ticket Request System)\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-1770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1770)\nSupport bundle generated files could contain sensitive information\n that might be unwanted to be disclosed.\n* [CVE-2020-1772](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1772)\nItâs possible to craft Lost Password requests with wildcards in the\n Token value, which allows attacker to retrieve valid Token(s),\n generated by users which already requested new passwords.\n* [CVE-2020-1774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1774)\nWhen user downloads PGP or S/MIME keys/certificates, exported file\n has same name for private and public keys. Therefore itâs possible\n to mix them and to send private key to the third-party instead of\n public key.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.3.18-1+deb8u15.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your otrs2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
