	"details": "\nA privilege escalation vulnerability vulnerability was discovered in\n[Net-SNMP](http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/), a set of tools for\ncollecting and organising information about devices on computer networks.\n\n\nUpstream notes that:\n\n\n* It is still possible to enable this MIB via the --with-mib-modules\nconfigure option.\n* Another MIB that provides similar functionality, namely\nucd-snmp/extensible, is disabled by default.\n* The security risk of ucd-snmp/pass and\nucd-snmp/pass\\_persist is lower since these modules only introduce a\nsecurity risk if the invoked scripts are exploitable.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.7.3+dfsg-1.7+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your net-snmp packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
