When receiving an EAP Request\nmessage in client mode, an attacker was able to overflow the rhostname\narray by providing a very long name. This issue is also mitigated by\nDebian's hardening build flags.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.4.6-3.1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ppp packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
