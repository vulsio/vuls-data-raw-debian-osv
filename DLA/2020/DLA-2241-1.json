	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-8839](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8839)\nA race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation.\n A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service\n (filesystem corruption).\n* [CVE-2018-14610](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14610), [CVE-2018-14611](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14611), [CVE-2018-14612](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14612), [CVE-2018-14613](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14613)\nWen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes\n could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.\n An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a\n denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-5108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5108)\nMitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11\n (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger\n roaming for a newly associated station before the station was\n authenticated. An attacker within range of the AP could use this\n to cause a denial of service, either by filling up a switching\n table or by redirecting traffic away from other stations.\n* [CVE-2019-19319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19319)\nJungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4\n implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user\n permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of\n service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-19447](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19447)\nIt was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely\n handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,\n already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount\n arbitrary ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service\n (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-19768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19768)\nTristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug\n facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able\n to trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to\n cause a denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-20636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20636)\nThe syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully\n validate keycode changes, which could result in a heap\n out-of-bounds write. A local user permitted to access the device\n node for an input or VT device could possibly use this to cause a\n denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-0009](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0009)\nJann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent\n read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as\n read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian\n kernel configurations.\n* [CVE-2020-0543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0543)\nResearchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs\n supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random\n value generated by these instructions may be used in a later\n speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.\n Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a\n local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive\n information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.\n\n\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either\n as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode\n package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update\n only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to\n disable the mitigation if it is not needed.\n* [CVE-2020-1749](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1749)\nXiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top\n of IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by\n IPsec, IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result\n in disclosure of information over the network, since it would not\n be encrypted or routed according to the system policy.\n* [CVE-2020-2732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-2732)\nPaulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel\n processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2\n guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an\n L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or\n information leaks in the L1 guest.\n* [CVE-2020-8647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8647), [CVE-2020-8649](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8649)\nThe Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in\n the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual\n terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver\n could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-8648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8648)\nThe syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal\n driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user\n permitted to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a\n denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-9383](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9383)\nJordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver\n which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user\n permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a\n denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-10690](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10690)\nIt was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not\n properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock\n from the system while a user process was using it could lead to a\n use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2020-10751](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10751)\nDmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly\n handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged\n attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.\n* [CVE-2020-10942](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10942)\nIt was discovered that the vhost\\_net driver did not properly\n validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user\n permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack\n corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of\n service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-11494](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11494)\nIt was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver\n did not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets,\n resulting in an information leak from the kernel to user-space or\n over the CAN network.\n* [CVE-2020-11565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11565)\nEntropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did\n not correctly handle an mpol mount option specifying an empty\n node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user\n namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a\n denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-11608](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11608), [CVE-2020-11609](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11609), [CVE-2020-11668](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11668)\nIt was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink\\_cit media\n drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A\n physically present user with a specially constructed USB device\n could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly\n for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-12114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12114)\nPiotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and\n pivot\\_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user\n with the CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use\n this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2020-12464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12464)\nKyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can\n result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be\n exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-12652](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12652)\nTom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers.\n An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice,\n creating a race condition which could result in incorrect locking\n of internal data structures. A local user permitted to access\n /dev/mptctl could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-12653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12653)\nIt was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not\n sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap\n buffer overflow. A local user with CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability could\n use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)\n or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-12654](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12654)\nIt was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not\n sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point\n (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP\n could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.\n* [CVE-2020-12769](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12769)\nIt was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly\n serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of\n this is unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's\n binary packages.\n* [CVE-2020-12770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12770)\nIt was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not\n correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.\n A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use\n this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).\n* [CVE-2020-12826](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12826)\nAdam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's\n permission checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal\n for a child process to send when it exits, but if the parent has\n executed a new program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A\n local user permitted to run a program for several days could\n bypass this check, execute a setuid program, and then send an\n arbitrary signal to it. Depending on the setuid programs\n installed, this could have some security impact.\n* [CVE-2020-13143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13143)\nKyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in\n the USB gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to\n the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a\n denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially\n for privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.16.84-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
