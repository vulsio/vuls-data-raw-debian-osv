	"summary": "linux-4.19 - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,\ndenial of service or information leaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-12351](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12351)\nAndy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation in the\n way L2CAP packets with A2MP CID are handled. A remote attacker in\n short distance knowing the victim's Bluetooth device address can\n send a malicious l2cap packet and cause a denial of service or\n possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.\n* [CVE-2020-12352](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12352)\nAndy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation. Stack\n memory is not properly initialised when handling certain AMP\n packets. A remote attacker in short distance knowing the victim's\n Bluetooth device address address can retrieve kernel stack\n information.\n* [CVE-2020-25211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25211)\nA flaw was discovered in netfilter subsystem. A local attacker\n able to inject conntrack Netlink configuration can cause a denial\n of service.\n* [CVE-2020-25643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25643)\nChenNan Of Chaitin Security Research Lab discovered a flaw in the\n hdlc\\_ppp module. Improper input validation in the ppp\\_cp\\_parse\\_cr()\n function may lead to memory corruption and information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2020-25645](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25645)\nA flaw was discovered in the interface driver for GENEVE\n encapsulated traffic when combined with IPsec. If IPsec is\n configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the\n GENEVE tunnel, tunneled data isn't correctly routed over the\n encrypted link and sent unencrypted instead.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.19.152-1~deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-4.19>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
