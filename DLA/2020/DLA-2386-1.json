	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the Perl5 Database\nInterface (DBI). An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS)\nand possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-20919](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20919)\nThe hv\\_fetch() documentation requires checking for NULL and the\n code does that. But, shortly thereafter, it calls SvOK(profile),\n causing a NULL pointer dereference.\n* [CVE-2020-14392](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-14392)\nAn untrusted pointer dereference flaw was found in Perl-DBI. A\n local attacker who is able to manipulate calls to\n dbd\\_db\\_login6\\_sv() could cause memory corruption, affecting the\n service's availability.\n* [CVE-2020-14393](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-14393)\nA buffer overflow on via an overlong DBD class name in\n dbih\\_setup\\_handle function may lead to data be written past the\n intended limit.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.636-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libdbi-perl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libdbi-perl please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libdbi-perl>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
