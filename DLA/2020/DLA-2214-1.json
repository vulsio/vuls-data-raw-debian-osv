	"details": "\nVarious vulnerabilities have been addressed in libexif, a library to\nparse EXIF metadata files.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-6328](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6328)\nAn integer overflow when parsing the MNOTE entry data of the input\n file had been found. This could have caused Denial-of-Service (DoS)\n and Information Disclosure (disclosing some critical heap chunk\n metadata, even other applications' private data).\n* [CVE-2017-7544](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7544)\nlibexif had been vulnerable to out-of-bounds heap read vulnerability\n in exif\\_data\\_save\\_data\\_entry function in libexif/exif-data.c caused\n by improper length computation of the allocated data of an ExifMnote\n entry which could have caused denial-of-service or possibly information\n disclosure.\n* [CVE-2018-20030](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20030)\nAn error when processing the EXIF\\_IFD\\_INTEROPERABILITY and\n EXIF\\_IFD\\_EXIF tags within libexif version could have been exploited\n to exhaust available CPU resources.\n* [CVE-2020-0093](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0093)\nIn exif\\_data\\_save\\_data\\_entry of exif-data.c, there was a possible out\n of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could have lead to\n local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges\n needed. User interaction was needed for exploitation.\n* [CVE-2020-12767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12767)\nlibexif had a divide-by-zero error in exif\\_entry\\_get\\_value in\n exif-entry.c\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.6.21-2+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libexif packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
