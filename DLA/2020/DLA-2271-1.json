	"details": "\nIn coturn before version 4.5.1.3, there is an issue whereby\nSTUN/TURN response buffer is not initialized properly. There\nis a leak of information between different client connections.\nOne client (an attacker) could use their connection to\nintelligently query coturn to get interesting bytes in the\npadding bytes from the connection of another client.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n4.2.1.2-1+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your coturn packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
