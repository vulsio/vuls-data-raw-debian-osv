	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-13093](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-13093), [CVE-2018-13094](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-13094)\nWen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported several NULL pointer\n dereference flaws that may be triggered when mounting and\n operating a crafted XFS volume. An attacker able to mount\n arbitrary XFS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service\n (crash).\n* [CVE-2018-20976](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20976)\nIt was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not\n correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead\n to a use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2018-21008](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-21008)\nIt was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly\n handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after free. The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2019-0136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0136)\nIt was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)\n did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)\n messages. A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service\n (loss of wifi connectivity).\n* [CVE-2019-2215](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-2215)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in\n the Android binder driver. A local user on a system with this\n driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\n corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.\n* [CVE-2019-10220](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10220)\nVarious developers and researchers found that if a crafted file system or malicious file server presented a directory with\n filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and\n possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the\n directory.\n\n\nThe kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,\n rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.\n* [CVE-2019-14615](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14615)\nIt was discovered that Intel 9th and 10th generation GPUs did not\n clear user-visible state during a context switch, which resulted\n in information leaks between GPU tasks. This has been mitigated\n in the i915 driver.\n\n\nThe affected chips (gen9 and gen10) are listed at\n .\n* [CVE-2019-14814](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14814), [CVE-2019-14815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14815), [CVE-2019-14816](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14816)\nMultiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which\n could lead to heap buffer overflows.

On systems using this driver, a\n malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these\n to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or\n possibly for remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2019-14896](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14896), [CVE-2019-14897](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14897)\nADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer\n overflows in the libertas wifi driver. On systems using this\n driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could\n use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or\n crash) or possibly for remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2019-15098](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15098)\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer reported that the ath6kl wifi driver\n did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead to a\n null pointer derefernce. An attacker able to add USB devices\n could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).\n* [CVE-2019-15217](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15217)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered that the zr364xx mdia driver did not\n correctly handle devices without a product name string, which\n could lead to a null pointer dereference. An attacker able to add\n USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service\n (BUG/oops).\n* [CVE-2019-15291](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15291)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered that the b2c2-flexcop-usb media\n driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead\n to a null pointer dereference. An attacker able to add USB\n devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).\n* [CVE-2019-15505](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15505)\nThe syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver\n did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to\n a heap buffer over-read. An attacker able to add USB devices\n could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read\n sensitive information from kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2019-15917](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15917)\nThe syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting\n UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use after-free. A local user with access to a pty device or other\n suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service\n (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-16746](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16746)\nIt was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content\n of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface\n in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.\n A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use\n this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-17052](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17052), [CVE-2019-17053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17053), [CVE-2019-17054](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17054), [CVE-2019-17055](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17055), [CVE-2019-17056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17056)\nOri Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations\n - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all\n users to create raw sockets. A local user could use this to send\n arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.\n* [CVE-2019-17075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17075)\nIt was found that the cxgb4 Infiniband driver requested DMA\n (Direct Memory Access) to a stack-allocated buffer, which is not\n supported and on some systems can result in memory corruption of\n the stack. A local user might be able to use this for denial of\n service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-17133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17133)\nNicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate\n received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a\n buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.\n A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to\n cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for\n remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2019-17666](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17666)\nNicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not\n properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer\n overflow.

This could enable tracking individual computers as they\n communicate with different remote servers and from different\n networks. The siphash function is now used instead.\n* [CVE-2019-18683](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18683)\nMultiple race conditions were discovered in the vivid media\n driver, used for testing Video4Linux2 (V4L2) applications,\n These race conditions could result in a use-after-free. On a\n system where this driver is loaded, a user with permission\n to access media devices could use this to cause a denial\n of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-18809](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18809)\nNavid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the af9005\n media driver if the device fails to respond to a command.
