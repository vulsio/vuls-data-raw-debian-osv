	"details": "\nA potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in rails,\na ruby based MVC framework. Views that allow the user to control the\ndefault (not found) value of the `t` and `translate` helpers could be\nsusceptible to XSS attacks. When an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the\ndefault for a missing translation key named html or ending in \\_html, the\ndefault string is incorrectly marked as HTML-safe and not escaped.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n2:4.2.7.1-1+deb9u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of rails please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rails>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
