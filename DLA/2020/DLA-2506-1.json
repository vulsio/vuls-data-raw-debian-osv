	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Awstats, a web server log analyzer, was\nvulnerable to path traversal attacks. A remote unauthenticated\nattacker could leverage that to perform arbitrary code execution. The\nprevious fix did not fully address the issue when the default\n/etc/awstats/awstats.conf is not present.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n7.6+dfsg-1+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your awstats packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of awstats please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/awstats>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
