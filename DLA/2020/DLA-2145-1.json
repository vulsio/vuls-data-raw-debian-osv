	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there were a number of HTTP request splitting\nvulnerabilities in Twisted, an Python event-based framework for building\nvarious types of internet applications.\n\n\nFor more information, please see the\n[upstream advisory.](https://know.bishopfox.com/advisories/twisted-version-19.10.0#INOR)\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-10108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10108)\nIn Twisted Web through 19.10.0, there was an HTTP request splitting\n vulnerability. When presented with two content-length headers, it ignored\n the first header. When the second content-length value was set to zero, the\n request body was interpreted as a pipelined request.\n* [CVE-2020-10109](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10109)\nIn Twisted Web through 19.10.0, there was an HTTP request splitting\n vulnerability. When presented with a content-length and a chunked encoding\n header, the content-length took precedence and the remainder of the request\n body was interpreted as a pipelined request.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n14.0.2-3+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your twisted packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
