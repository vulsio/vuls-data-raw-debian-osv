	"summary": "sa-exim - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was found that sa-exim, the SpamAssassin filter for Exim, allows\nattackers to execute arbitrary code if users are allowed to run custom\nrules. A similar issue was fixed in spamassassin, [CVE-2018-11805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11805), which\ncaused a functional regression in sa-exim. This update restores the\ncompatibility between spamassassin and sa-exim. The security\nimplications of sa-exim's greylisting function are also documented in\n/usr/share/doc/sa-exim/README.greylisting.gz.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n4.2.1-14+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sa-exim packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
