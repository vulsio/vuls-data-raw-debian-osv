This could\nresult\nin information disclosure or even the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-9497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9497)\nApache Guacamole does not properly validate data received from RDP\n servers via static virtual channels. If a user connects to a\n malicious or compromised RDP server, specially-crafted PDUs could\n result in disclosure of information within the memory of the guacd\n process handling the connection.\n* [CVE-2020-9498](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9498)\nApache Guacamole may mishandle pointers involved in processing data\n received via RDP static virtual channels. If a user connects to a\n malicious or compromised RDP server, a series of specially-crafted\n PDUs could result in memory corruption, possibly allowing arbitrary\n code to be executed with the privileges of the running guacd\n process.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.9.9-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your guacamole-server packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of guacamole-server please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/guacamole-server>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
