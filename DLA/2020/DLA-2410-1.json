A remote attacker could\n potentially cause a denial of service or code execution, during service\n discovery, due to a redundant disconnect MGMT event.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.43-2+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bluez packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
