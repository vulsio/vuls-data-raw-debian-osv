	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in package salt, a\nconfiguration management and infrastructure automation software.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-11651](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11651)\nThe salt-master process ClearFuncs class does not properly validate\n method calls. This allows a remote user to access some methods\n without authentication. These methods can be used to retrieve user\n tokens from the salt master and/or run arbitrary commands on salt\n minions.\n* [CVE-2020-11652](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11652)\nThe salt-master process ClearFuncs class allows access to some\n methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow\n arbitrary directory access to authenticated users.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2014.1.13+ds-3+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your salt packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
