	"summary": "python2.7 - security update",
	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python2.7, an interactive\nhigh-level object-oriented language.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-20852](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20852)\nBy using a malicious server an attacker might steal cookies that are\n meant for other domains.\n* [CVE-2019-5010](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5010)\nNULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.\n* [CVE-2019-9636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9636)\nImproper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)\n during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure\n (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given\n hostname). A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to\n locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to\n a different host than when parsed correctly.\n* [CVE-2019-9740](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9740)\nAn issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible\n if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the\n first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \\r\\n (specifically in\n the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or\n a Redis command.\n* [CVE-2019-9947](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9947)\nAn issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible\n if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the\n first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \\r\\n (specifically in\n the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an\n HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the [CVE-2019-9740](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9740)\n query string issue.\n* [CVE-2019-9948](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9948)\nurllib supports the local\\_file: scheme, which makes it easier for\n remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist\n file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a\n urllib.urlopen('local\\_file:///etc/passwd') call.\n* [CVE-2019-10160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10160)\nA security regression of [CVE-2019-9636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9636) was discovered which still\n allows an attacker to exploit [CVE-2019-9636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9636) by abusing the user and\n password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied\n URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of\n information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially\n crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information\n (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different\n host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly\n parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.\n* [CVE-2019-16056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16056)\nThe email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain\n multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and\n implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message\n could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be\n denied.\n* [CVE-2019-20907](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20907)\nOpening a crafted tar file could result in an infinite loop due to\n missing header validation.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.7.13-2+deb9u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python2.7 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python2.7>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
