	"details": "\nSeveral issues have been found in python-apt, a python interface to libapt-pkg.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-15795](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15795)\nIt was discovered that python-apt would still use MD5 hashes to validate\n certain downloaded packages. If a remote attacker were able to perform a\n man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to install\n altered packages.\n* [CVE-2019-15796](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15796)\nIt was discovered that python-apt could install packages from untrusted\n repositories, contrary to expectations.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.9.3.13.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-apt packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
