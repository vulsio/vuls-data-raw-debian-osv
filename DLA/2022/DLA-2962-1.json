	"details": "\nMultiple security issues were discovered in pjproject, is a free and\nopen source multimedia communication library.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-32686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-32686)\nA race condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted\n socket having no group lock. Second, the SSL socket\n parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake. s. They cause\n crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2021-37706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-37706)\nAn incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the\n header length is not checked before performing a subtraction\n operation, potentially resulting in an integer underflow scenario.\n This issue affects all users that use STUN. A malicious actor\n located within the victimâs network may forge and send a specially\n crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary\n code on the victimâs machine\n* [CVE-2021-41141](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41141)\nIn various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found\n that the function returns without releasing the currently held\n locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a\n denial of service for the users.\n* [CVE-2021-43299](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43299)\nStack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua\\_player\\_create. An\n attacker-controlled filename argument may cause a buffer\n overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without\n any size validation.\n* [CVE-2021-43300](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43300)\nStack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua\\_recorder\\_create. An\n attacker-controlled filename argument may cause a buffer\n overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without\n any size validation.\n* [CVE-2021-43301](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43301)\nStack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua\\_playlist\\_create. An\n attacker-controlled file\\_names argument may cause a buffer\n overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without\n any size validation.\n* [CVE-2021-43302](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43302)\nRead out-of-bounds in PJSUA API when calling\n pjsua\\_recorder\\_create. An attacker-controlled filename argument\n may cause an out-of-bounds read when the filename is shorter than\n 4 characters.\n* [CVE-2021-43303](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43303)\nBuffer overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua\\_call\\_dump. An\n attacker-controlled buffer argument may cause a buffer overflow,\n since supplying an output buffer smaller than 128 characters may\n overflow the output buffer, regardless of the maxlen argument\n supplied\n* [CVE-2021-43804](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43804)\nAn incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's length, this\n declared length is not checked against the actual received packet\n size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access. A\n malicious actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason\n length\n* [CVE-2021-43845](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43845)\nif incoming RTCP XR message contain block, the data field is not\n checked against the received packet size, potentially resulting in\n an out-of-bound read access\n* [CVE-2022-21722](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21722)\nit is possible that certain incoming RTP/RTCP packets can\n potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This issue affects\n all users that use PJMEDIA and accept incoming RTP/RTCP.\n* [CVE-2022-21723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21723)\nParsing an incoming SIP message that contains a malformed\n multipart can potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This\n issue affects all PJSIP users that accept SIP multipart.\n* [CVE-2022-23608](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23608)\nWhen in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by\n multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one\n of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to\n be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different\n hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list\n collision which eventually leading to endless loop\n* [CVE-2022-24754](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24754)\nThere is a stack-buffer overflow vulnerability which only impacts\n PJSIP users who accept hashed digest credentials (credentials with\n data\\_type `PJSIP\\_CRED\\_DATA\\_DIGEST`).\n* [CVE-2022-24764](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24764)\nA stack buffer overflow vulnerability that affects PJSUA2 users\n or users that call the API `pjmedia\\_sdp\\_print(),\n pjmedia\\_sdp\\_media\\_print()`\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.5.5~dfsg-6+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pjproject packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of pjproject please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pjproject>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
