	"summary": "node-log4js - security update",
	"details": "\nIn node-log4js, a port of log4js in Node.js, default file permissions\nfor log files created by the file, fileSync, and dateFile appenders are\nworld-readable. This could cause problems if log files contain sensitive\ninformation. This would affect any users that have not supplied their\nown permissions for the files via the mode parameter in the config.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n4.0.2-2+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your node-log4js packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of node-log4js please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/node-log4js>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
