	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Node.js, a JavaScript\nruntime environment, which could result in memory corruption, invalid\ncertificate validation, prototype pollution or command injection.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-22930](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22930), [CVE-2021-22940](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22940)\nUse after free attack where an attacker might be able to exploit\n the memory corruption, to change process behavior.\n* [CVE-2021-22939](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22939)\nIf the Node.js https API was used incorrectly and undefined was\n in passed for the rejectUnauthorized parameter, no error was\n returned and connections to servers with an expired certificate\n would have been accepted.\n* [CVE-2022-21824](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21824)\nDue to the formatting logic of the \"console.table()\" function it\n was not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the\n properties parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object\n with at least one property as the first parameter, which could be\n \\_\\_proto\\_\\_.\n* [CVE-2022-32212](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32212)\nOS Command Injection vulnerability due to an insufficient\n IsAllowedHost check that can easily be bypassed because\n IsIPAddress does not properly check if an IP address is invalid\n before making DBS requests allowing rebinding attacks.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n10.24.0~dfsg-1~deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nodejs packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of nodejs please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/nodejs>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
