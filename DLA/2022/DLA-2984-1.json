	],
	"summary": "condor - security update",
	"details": "\nJaime Frey discovered a flaw in HTCondor, a distributed workload management\nsystem. An attacker need only have READ-level authorization to a vulnerable\ndaemon using the CLAIMTOBE authentication method. This means they are able to\nrun tools like condor\\_q or condor\\_status. Many pools do not restrict who can\nissue READ-level commands, and CLAIMTOBE is allowed for READ-level commands in\nthe default configuration. Thus, it is likely that an attacker could execute\nthis command remotely from an untrusted network, unless prevented by a firewall\nor other network-level access controls.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n8.4.11~dfsg.1-1+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your condor packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of condor please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/condor>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
