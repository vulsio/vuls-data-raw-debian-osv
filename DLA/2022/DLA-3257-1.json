	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an issue in Emacs where where attackers\ncould have executed arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the name of\na source-code file.\n\n\nThis was because lib-src/etags.c used the system(3) library function when\ncalling the (external) ctags(1) binary.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-45939](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-45939)\nGNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell\n metacharacters in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c\n uses the system C library function in its implementation of the ctags\n program. For example, a victim may use the \"ctags \\*\" command (suggested in\n the ctags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory\n has contents that depend on untrusted input.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:26.1+1-3.2+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your emacs packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
