	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Cacti, a web interface for\ngraphing of monitoring systems, leading to authentication bypass and\ncross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker may get access to unauthorized\nareas and impersonate other users, under certain conditions.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-10060](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10060)\nCacti has XSS because it does not properly reject unintended\n characters, related to use of the sanitize\\_uri function in\n lib/functions.php.\n* [CVE-2018-10061](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10061)\nCacti has XSS because it makes certain htmlspecialchars calls\n without the ENT\\_QUOTES flag (these calls occur when the\n html\\_escape function in lib/html.php is not used).\n* [CVE-2019-11025](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11025)\nNo escaping occurs before printing out the value of the SNMP\n community string (SNMP Options) in the View poller cache, leading\n to XSS.\n* [CVE-2020-7106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-7106)\nCacti has stored XSS in multiple files as demonstrated by the\n description parameter in data\\_sources.php (a raw string from the\n database that is displayed by $header to trigger the XSS).\n* [CVE-2020-13230](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13230)\nDisabling a user account does not immediately invalidate any\n permissions granted to that account (e.g., permission to view\n logs).\n* [CVE-2020-23226](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-23226)\nMultiple Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in\n multiple files.\n* [CVE-2021-23225](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23225)\nCacti allows authenticated users with User Management permissions\n to inject arbitrary web script or HTML in the new\\_username field\n during creation of a new user via Copy method at user\\_admin.php.\n* [CVE-2022-0730](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0730)\nUnder certain ldap conditions, Cacti authentication can be\n bypassed with certain credential types.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.8.8h+ds1-10+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of cacti please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cacti>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
