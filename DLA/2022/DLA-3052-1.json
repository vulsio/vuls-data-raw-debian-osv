	"details": "\nIt was discovered that the Cyrus IMAP server was prone to a denial of service\nattack via input that is mishandled during hash-table interaction. Furthermore\nit allowed privilege escalation because an HTTP request may be interpreted in\nthe authentication context of an unrelated previous request that arrived over\nthe same connection.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.5.10-3+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of cyrus-imapd please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cyrus-imapd>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
