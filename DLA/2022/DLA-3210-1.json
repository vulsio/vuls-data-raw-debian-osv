	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in gerbv, a Gerber file viewer. Most\nPrinted Circuit Board (PCB) design programs can export data to a Gerber\nfile.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-40401](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-40401):\n A use-after-free vulnerability existed in the RS-274X aperture definition\n tokenization functionality. A specially-crafted gerber file could have led to\n code execution.\n* [CVE-2021-40403](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-40403):\n An information disclosure vulnerability existed in the pick-and-place\n rotation parsing functionality. A specially-crafted pick-and-place file could\n have exploited the missing initialization of a structure in order to leak\n memory contents.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.7.0-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gerbv packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
