Prior to these checks, it\nwas possible to overflow arguments to e.g. malloc and thus cause out-of-bounds\nmemory accesses.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.19.2-2+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libraw packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libraw please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libraw>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
