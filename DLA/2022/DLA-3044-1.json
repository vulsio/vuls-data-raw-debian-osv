	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities were found in glib2.0, a general-purpose\nutility library for the GNOME environment.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-27218](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27218)\nIf g\\_byte\\_array\\_new\\_take() was called with a buffer of 4GB or more on a\n 64-bit platform, the length would be truncated modulo 2\\*\\*32, causing\n unintended length truncation.\n* [CVE-2021-27219](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27219)\nThe function g\\_bytes\\_new has an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to\n an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow could potentially\n lead to memory corruption.\n* [CVE-2021-28153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28153)\nWhen g\\_file\\_replace() is used with G\\_FILE\\_CREATE\\_REPLACE\\_DESTINATION to\n replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the\n target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have\n security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is\n a symlink to a file that already exists, then the contents of that file\n correctly remain unchanged.)\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.50.3-2+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your glib2.0 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of glib2.0 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/glib2.0>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
