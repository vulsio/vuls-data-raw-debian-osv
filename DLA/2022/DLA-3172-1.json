	"details": "\nIt was discovered that libxml2, the GNOME XML library, was vulnerable to\ninteger overflows and memory corruption.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-40303](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-40303)\nParsing a XML document with the XML\\_PARSE\\_HUGE option enabled can result\n in an integer overflow because safety checks were missing in some\n functions. Also, the xmlParseEntityValue function did not have any length\n limitation.\n* [CVE-2022-40304](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-40304)\nWhen a reference cycle is detected in the XML entity cleanup function the\n XML entity data can be stored in a dictionary. In this case, the\n dictionary becomes corrupted resulting in logic errors, including memory\n errors like double free.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.9.4+dfsg1-7+deb10u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libxml2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxml2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
