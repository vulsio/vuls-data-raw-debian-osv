	"details": "\nThomas Chauchefoin from SonarSource discovered that in Zabbix, a\nserver/client network monitoring system, after the initial setup\nprocess, some steps of setup.php file are reachable not only by\nsuper-administrators, but by unauthenticated users as well. An\nattacker could bypass checks and potentially change the configuration\nof Zabbix Frontend.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:3.0.32+dfsg-0+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of zabbix please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zabbix>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
