	"summary": "heimdal - security update",
	"details": "\nMultiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in heimdal, an\nimplementation of the Kerberos 5 authentication protocol, which may\nresult in denial of service, information disclosure, or remote code\nexecution.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-14870](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14870)\nIsaac Boukris reported that the Heimdal KDC before 7.7.1 does not\n apply delegation\\_not\\_allowed (aka not-delegated) user attributes for\n S4U2Self. Instead the forwardable flag is set even if the\n impersonated client has the not-delegated flag set.\n* [CVE-2021-3671](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3671)\nJoseph Sutton discovered that the Heimdal KDC before 7.7.1 does not\n check for missing missing sname in TGS-REQ (Ticket Granting Server Request) before before dereferencing. An authenticated user could\n use this flaw to crash the KDC.\n* [CVE-2021-44758](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44758)\nIt was discovered that Heimdal is prone to a NULL dereference in\n acceptors when the initial SPNEGO token has no acceptable\n mechanisms, which may result in denial of service for a server\n application that uses the Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation\n Mechanism (SPNEGO).\n* [CVE-2022-3437](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3437)\nEvgeny Legerov reported that the DES and Triple-DES decryption\n routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI library before 7.7.1 were prone to\n buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory when presented with a\n maliciously small packet. In addition, the Triple-DES and RC4\n (arcfour) decryption routine were prone to non-constant time leaks,\n which could potentially yield to a leak of secret key material when\n using these ciphers.\n* [CVE-2022-41916](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41916)\nIt was discovered that Heimdal's PKI certificate validation library\n before 7.7.1 can under some circumstances perform an out-of-bounds\n memory access when normalizing Unicode, which may result in denial\n of service.\n* [CVE-2022-42898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42898)\nGreg Hudson discovered an integer multiplication overflow in the\n Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) parsing routine, which may\n result in denial of service for Heimdal KDCs and possibly Heimdal\n servers (e.g., via GSS-API) on 32-bit systems.\n* [CVE-2022-44640](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-44640)\nDouglas Bagnall and the Heimdal maintainers independently discovered\n that Heimdal's ASN.1 compiler before 7.7.1 generates code that\n allows specially crafted DER encodings of CHOICEs to invoke the\n wrong free() function on the decoded structure upon decode error,\n which may result in remote code execution in the Heimdal KDC and\n possibly the Kerberos client, the X.509 library, and other\n components as well.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.5.0+dfsg-3+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of heimdal please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/heimdal>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
