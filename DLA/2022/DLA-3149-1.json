	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Nokogiri, an\nHTML/XML/SAX/Reader parser for the Ruby programming language, leading\nto command injection, XML external entity injection (XXE), and\ndenial-of-service (DoS).\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-5477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5477)\nA command injection vulnerability allows commands to be executed\n in a subprocess via Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are\n vulnerable only if the undocumented method\n `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load\\_file` is being called with unsafe\n user input as the filename. This vulnerability appears in code\n generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical\n is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing\n CSS queries.\n* [CVE-2020-26247](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26247)\nXXE vulnerability: XML Schemas parsed by Nokogiri::XML::Schema are\n trusted by default, allowing external resources to be accessed\n over the network, potentially enabling XXE or SSRF attacks. This\n behavior is counter to the security policy followed by Nokogiri\n maintainers, which is to treat all input as untrusted by default\n whenever possible.\n* [CVE-2022-24836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24836)\nNokogiri contains an inefficient regular expression that is\n susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to detect\n encoding in HTML documents.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.10.0+dfsg1-2+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-nokogiri packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of ruby-nokogiri please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-nokogiri>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
