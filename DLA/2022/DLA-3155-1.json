	"details": "\nThe Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation issue\nwhen processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. This can be used to corrupt Java\nclass files generated by the internal XSLTC compiler and execute arbitrary Java\nbytecode. In Debian the vulnerable code is in the bcel source package.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n6.2-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bcel packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of bcel please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bcel>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
