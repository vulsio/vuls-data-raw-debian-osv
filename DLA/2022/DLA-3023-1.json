	"summary": "puma - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in puma, a web server for\nRuby/Rack applications. These flaws may lead to information leakage due to not\nalways closing response bodies, allowing untrusted input in a response header\n(HTTP Response Splitting) and thus potentially facilitating several other\nattacks like cross-site scripting. A poorly-behaved client could also use\nkeepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service\nattack.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.6.0-1+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your puma packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of puma please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/puma>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
