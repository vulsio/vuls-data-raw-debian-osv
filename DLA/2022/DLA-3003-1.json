	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential denial of service attack in\nruby-nokogiri, a HTML, XML, SAX etc. parser written in/for the Ruby programming\nlanguage. This was caused by the use of inefficient regular expressions that\nwere susceptible to excessive backtracking.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-24836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24836)\nCVE-2022-24836: Nokogiri is an open source XML and HTML library for\n Ruby. Nokogiri `< v1.13.4` contains an inefficient regular\n expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when\n attempting to detect encoding in HTML documents. Users are advised to\n upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.4`. There are no known workarounds for\n this issue.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.6.8.1-1+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-nokogiri packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
