	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in openjpeg2, the open-source\nJPEG 2000 codec.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-27842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27842)\nNull pointer dereference through specially crafted input. The highest impact\n of this flaw is to application availability.\n* [CVE-2020-27843](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27843)\nThe flaw allows an attacker to provide specially crafted input to the\n conversion or encoding functionality, causing an out-of-bounds read. The\n highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.\n* [CVE-2021-29338](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-29338)\nInteger overflow allows remote attackers to crash the application, causing a\n denial of service. This occurs when the attacker uses the command line\n option \"-ImgDir\" on a directory that contains 1048576 files.\n* [CVE-2022-1122](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1122)\nInput directory with a large number of files can lead to a segmentation\n fault and a denial of service due to a call of free() on an uninitialized\n pointer.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.1.2-1.1+deb9u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openjpeg2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openjpeg2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openjpeg2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
