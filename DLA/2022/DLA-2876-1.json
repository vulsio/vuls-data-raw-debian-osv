A successful\n exploitation may lead to code execution.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2:8.0.0197-4+deb9u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of vim please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/vim>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
