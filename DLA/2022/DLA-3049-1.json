	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Mailman, a web-based\nmailing list manager. An attacker could impersonate more privileged\naccounts through different vectors.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-43331](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43331)\nA crafted URL to the Cgi/options.py user options page can execute\n arbitrary JavaScript for XSS.\n* [CVE-2021-43332](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43332)\nThe CSRF token for the Cgi/admindb.py admindb page contains an\n encrypted version of the list admin password. This could\n potentially be cracked by a moderator via an offline brute-force\n attack.\n* [CVE-2021-44227](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44227)\nA list member or moderator can get a CSRF token and craft an admin\n request (using that token) to set a new admin password or make\n other changes.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:2.1.23-1+deb9u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of mailman please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/mailman>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
