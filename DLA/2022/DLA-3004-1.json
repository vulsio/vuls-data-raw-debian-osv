	"summary": "htmldoc - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an integer overflow vulnerabiliity in\nhtmldoc, a HTML processor that generates indexed HTML, PS and PDF files. This\nwas caused by a programming error in image\\_load\\_jpeg function due to a\nconflation or confusion of declared/expected/observed image dimensions.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-27114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-27114)\nCVE-2022-27114: There is a vulnerability in htmldoc 1.9.16. In\n image\\_load\\_jpeg function image.cxx when it calls malloc,'img->width'\n and 'img->height' they are large enough to cause an integer\n overflow. So, the malloc function may return a heap block smaller than the\n expected size, and it will cause a buffer overflow/Address boundary\n error in the jpeg\\_read\\_scanlines function.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.8.27-8+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your htmldoc packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
