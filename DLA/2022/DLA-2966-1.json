	"summary": "libgc - security update",
	"details": "\nlibgc, a conservative garbage collector, is vulnerable to integer\noverflows in multiple places. In some cases, when asked to allocate a huge\nquantity of memory, instead of failing the request, it will return a\npointer to a small amount of memory possibly tricking the application into\na buffer overwrite.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:7.4.2-8+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libgc packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libgc please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libgc>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
