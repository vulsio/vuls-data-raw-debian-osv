	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an information disclosure issue in\npython-treq, a high-level library/API for making HTTP requests using the\nTwisted network programming library. HTTP cookies were not bound to a single\ndomain and were instead sent to every domain.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-23607](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23607)\ntreq is an HTTP library inspired by requests but written on top of\n Twisted's Agents. Treq's request methods (`treq.get`, `treq.post`, etc.)\n and `treq.client.HTTPClient` constructor accept cookies as a dictionary.\n Such cookies are not bound to a single domain, and are therefore sent to\n \\*every\\* domain (\"supercookies\"). This can potentially cause sensitive\n information to leak upon an HTTP redirect to a different domain., e.g.\n should `https://example.com` redirect to `http://cloudstorageprovider.com`\n the latter will receive the cookie `session`. Treq 2021.1.0 and later bind\n cookies given to request methods (`treq.request`, `treq.get`,\n `HTTPClient.request`, `HTTPClient.get`, etc.) to the origin of the \\*url\\*\n parameter. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade\n Instead of passing a dictionary as the \\*cookies\\* argument, pass a\n `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance with properly domain- and scheme-scoped\n cookies in it.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n15.1.0-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-treq packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
