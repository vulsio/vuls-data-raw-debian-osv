	"details": "\nIt was discovered that zsh, a powerful shell and scripting language,\ndid not prevent recursive prompt expansion. This would allow an\nattacker to execute arbitrary commands into a user's shell, for\ninstance by tricking a vcs\\_info user into checking out a git branch\nwith a specially crafted name.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n5.3.1-4+deb9u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of zsh please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zsh>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
