	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential directory traversal\nvulnerablilty in ruby-tzinfo, a timezone library for the Ruby\nprogramming language.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-31163](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-31163)\nTZInfo is a Ruby library that provides access to time zone\n data and allows times to be converted using time zone rules.\n Versions prior to 0.36.1, as well as those prior to 1.2.10 when\n used with the Ruby data source tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to\n relative path traversal. With the Ruby data source, time zones\n are defined in Ruby files. There is one file per time zone. Time\n zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In the affected\n versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone\n identifiers correctly, allowing a new line character within the\n identifier. With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later,\n `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load unintended files with\n `require`, executing them within the Ruby process. Versions\n 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone\n identifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version\n 0.3.61 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if\n their name follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and\n the file has a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory\n in the load path. Applications should ensure that untrusted files\n are not placed in a directory on the load path. As a workaround,\n the time zone identifier can be validated before passing to\n `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it matches the regular\n expression\n `\\A[A-Za-z0-9+\\-\\_]+(?:\\/[A-Za-z0-9+\\-\\_]+)\\*\\z`.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.2.5-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-tzinfo packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
