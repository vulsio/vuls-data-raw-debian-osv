	"details": "\nNathan Davison discovered that HAProxy, a load balancing reverse proxy, did not\ncorrectly reject requests or responses featuring a transfer-encoding header\nmissing the chunked value which could facilitate a HTTP request smuggling\nattack. Furthermore several flaws were discovered in DNS related functions that\nmay trigger infinite recursion leading to a denial of service or to information\nleakage due to a out-of-bounds read.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.7.5-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of haproxy please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
