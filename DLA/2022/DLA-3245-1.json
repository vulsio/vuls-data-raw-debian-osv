	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-2978](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2978)\nbutt3rflyh4ck, Hao Sun, and Jiacheng Xu reported a flaw in the\n nilfs2 filesystem driver which can lead to a use-after-free. A\n local use might be able to exploit this to cause a denial of\n service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-3521](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3521)\nThe syzbot tool found a race condition in the KCM subsystem\n which could lead to a crash.\n\n\nThis subsystem is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2022-3524](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3524)\nThe syzbot tool found a race condition in the IPv6 stack which\n could lead to a memory leak. A local user could exploit this to\n cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n* [CVE-2022-3564](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3564)\nA flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which\n would lead to a use-after-free. This might be exploitable\n to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-3565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3565)\nA flaw was discovered in the mISDN driver which would lead to a\n use-after-free. This might be exploitable to cause a denial of\n service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-3594](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3594)\nAndrew Gaul reported that the r8152 Ethernet driver would log\n excessive numbers of messages in response to network errors. A\n remote attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of\n service (resource exhaustion).\n* [CVE-2022-3621](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3621), [CVE-2022-3646](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3646)\nThe syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which\n can lead to a null pointer dereference or memory leak. A user\n permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem images could use these to\n cause a denial of service (crash or resource exhaustion).\n* [CVE-2022-3628](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3628)\nDokyung Song, Jisoo Jang, and Minsuk Kang reported a potential\n heap-based buffer overflow in the brcmfmac Wi-Fi driver. A user\n able to connect a malicious USB device could exploit this to cause\n a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-3640](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3640)\nA flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which\n would lead to a use-after-free. This might be exploitable\n to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-3643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3643) (XSA-423)\n\n A flaw was discovered in the Xen network backend driver that would\n result in it generating malformed packet buffers. If these\n packets were forwarded to certain other network devices, a Xen\n guest could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or\n device reset).\n* [CVE-2022-3649](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3649)\nThe syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which\n can lead to a use-after-free. A user permitted to mount arbitrary\n filesystem images could use these to cause a denial of service\n (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-4378](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-4378)\nKyle Zeng found a flaw in procfs that would cause a stack-based\n buffer overflow. A local user permitted to write to a sysctl\n could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-20369](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-20369)\nA flaw was found in the v4l2-mem2mem media driver that would lead\n to an out-of-bounds write. A local user with access to such a\n device could exploit this for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-29901](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-29901)\nJohannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for Intel\n processors (Intel Core generation 6, 7 and 8), protections against\n speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in\n some circumstances, which may allow arbitrary speculative code\n execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.\n\n\nMore information can be found at\n <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html>\n* [CVE-2022-40768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-40768)\nhdthky reported that the stex SCSI adapter driver did not fully\n initialise a structure that is copied to user-space. A local user\n with access to such a device could exploit this to leak sensitive\n information.\n* [CVE-2022-41849](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41849)\nA race condition was discovered in the smscufx graphics driver,\n which could lead to a use-after-free. A user able to remove the\n physical device while also accessing its device node could exploit\n this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-41850](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41850)\nA race condition was discovered in the hid-roccat input driver,\n which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user able to access\n such a device could exploit this to cause a denial of service\n (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-42328](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42328), [CVE-2022-42329](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42329) (XSA-424)\n\n Yang Yingliang reported that the Xen network backend driver did\n not use the proper function to free packet buffers in one case,\n which could lead to a deadlock. A Xen guest could exploit this to\n cause a denial of service (hang).\n* [CVE-2022-42895](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42895)\nTam훯훲s Koczka reported a flaw in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem\n that would result in reading uninitialised memory. A nearby\n attacker able to make a Bluetooth connection could exploit\n this to leak sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2022-42896](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42896)\nTam훯훲s Koczka reported flaws in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem that\n can lead to a use-after-free. A nearby attacker able to make a\n Bluetooth SMP connection could exploit this to cause a denial of\n service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for remote code\n execution.\n* [CVE-2022-43750](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-43750)\nThe syzbot tool found that the USB monitor (usbmon) driver allowed\n user-space programs to overwrite the driver's data structures. A\n local user permitted to access a USB monitor device could exploit\n this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or\n possibly for privilege escalation. However, by default only the\n root user can access such devices.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.19.269-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
