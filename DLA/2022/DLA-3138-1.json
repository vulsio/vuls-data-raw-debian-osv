A remote attacker\n can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,\n resulting in a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2022-38178](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-38178)\nIt was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA\n algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker\n can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,\n resulting in a denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of bind9 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bind9>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
