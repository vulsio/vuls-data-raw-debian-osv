	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\nThis update is unfortunately not available for the armel architecture.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-1108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1108)\nIt was discovered that the random driver could generate random\n bytes through /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before\n gathering enough entropy that these would be unpredictable. This\n could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted\n communications.\n\n\nThe original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it\n caused the boot process to hang on many systems. In this version,\n the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in\n gathering entropy without needing a hardware RNG.\n* [CVE-2021-4149](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4149)\nHao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There\n is a potential lock imbalance in an error path. A local user\n might be able to exploit this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2021-39713](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39713)\nThe syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling\n subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user\n could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or\n crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-0494](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0494)\nThe scsi\\_ioctl() was susceptible to an information leak only\n exploitable by users with CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN or CAP\\_SYS\\_RAWIO\n capabilities.\n* [CVE-2022-0812](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0812)\nIt was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma)\n miscalculated the size of message headers, which could lead to a\n leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients.\n* [CVE-2022-0854](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0854)\nAli Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA\n subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature is needed, this\n might allow a local user to read sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2022-1011](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1011)\nJann Horn discovered a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space)\n implementation.

A local attacker\n can take advantage of this to read sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2022-1198](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1198)\nDuoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio\n driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could\n exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or\n crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-1199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1199)\nDuoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 hamradio\n protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer\n dereference. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of\n service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-1353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1353)\nThe TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF\\_KEY\n subsystem. A local user can receive a netlink message when an\n IPsec daemon registers with the kernel, and this could include\n sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2022-1516](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1516)\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25\n set of standardized network protocols, which can result in denial\n of service.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2022-1729](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1729)\nNorbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the perf subsystem\n which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The\n default settings in Debian prevent exploitation unless more\n permissive settings have been applied in the\n kernel.perf\\_event\\_paranoid sysctl.\n* [CVE-2022-1734](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1734)\nDuoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver\n that could lead to a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer\n dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for\n denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2022-1974](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1974)\n, [CVE-2022-1975](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1975)\n\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that the NFC netlink interface was\n suspectible to denial of service.\n* [CVE-2022-2153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2153)\nkangel reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86\n processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference.

An updated intel-microcode package may be provided at\n a later date. The updated CPU microcode may also be available as\n part of a system firmware (\"BIOS\") update.\n\n\nFurther information on the mitigation can be found at\n \n or in the linux-doc-4.9 package.\n* [CVE-2022-23036](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23036)\n, [CVE-2022-23037](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23037), [CVE-2022-23038](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23038), [CVE-2022-23039](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23039),\n[CVE-2022-23040](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23040), [CVE-2022-23041](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23041), [CVE-2022-23042](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23042) (XSA-396)\n\n\nDemi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab\n discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers\n misused the Xen grant table API in a way that could be exploited\n by a malicious device backend to cause data corruption, leaks of\n sensitive information, or a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2022-23960](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23960)\nResearchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in\n Arm processors can be exploited to create information side channels with speculative execution. This issue is similar to\n Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some\n processors.\n\n\nThis can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a\n different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,\n or from a KVM guest to the kernel.\n* [CVE-2022-24958](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24958)\nA flaw was discovered that the USB gadget subsystem that could\n lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to configure USB\n gadgets could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-26490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26490)\nBuffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core driver\n can result in denial of service or privilege escalation.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2022-26966](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26966)\nA flaw was discovered in the sr9700 USB networking driver. A local\n user able to attach a specially designed USB device could use this\n to leak sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2022-27223](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-27223)\nA flaw was discovered in the udc-xilinx USB gadget-mode controller\n driver. On systems using this driver, a malicious USB host could\n exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n corruption) or possibly to execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2022-28356](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28356)\nBeraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did\n not properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A\n local attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial\n of service.\n* [CVE-2022-28390](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28390)\nA double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-USB/ARM7\n CAN/USB interface driver.\n* [CVE-2022-30594](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-30594)\nJann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between ptrace and\n seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still\n permitted to use ptrace() could exploit this to remove the seccomp\n restrictions.\n* [CVE-2022-32250](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32250)\nAaron Adams discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter which may\n result in local privilege escalation to root.\n* [CVE-2022-33981](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-33981)\nYuan Ming from Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in\n the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl, which could\n lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy\n drive device could exploit this to cause a denial of service\n (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n This ioctl is now disabled by default.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.9.320-2.\n\n\nFor the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised\nimplementations of several cryptographic and CRC algorithms. For at\nleast AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to\na leak of sensitive information.\n\n\nThis update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates\n4.9.304-4.9.320 inclusive. The random driver has been backported from\nLinux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and correctness issues. Some\nchanges will be visible:\n\n\n- The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096. You may need\n to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space\n entropy gathering services to allow for this.\n\n\n- On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more\n uses of /dev/urandom before it is fully initialised. These uses\n were previously under-counted and this is not a regression.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
