	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-4159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4159)\nA flaw was found in the eBPF verifier which could lead to an\n out-of-bounds read. If unprivileged use of eBPF is enabled, this\n could leak sensitive information. This was already disabled by\n default, which would fully mitigate the vulnerability.\n* [CVE-2021-33655](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33655)\nA user with access to a framebuffer console device could cause a\n memory out-of-bounds write via the FBIOPUT\\_VSCREENINFO ioctl.\n* [CVE-2021-33656](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33656)\nA user with access to a framebuffer console device could cause a\n memory out-of-bounds write via some font setting ioctls. These\n obsolete ioctls have been removed.\n* [CVE-2022-1462](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1462)\nä¸ĺŞç reported a race condition in the pty (pseudo-terminal)\n subsystem that can lead to a slab out-of-bounds write. A local\n user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-1679](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1679)\nThe syzbot tool found a race condition in the ath9k\\_htc driver\n which can lead to a use-after-free. This might be exploitable to\n cause a denial service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly\n for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-2153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2153)\nkangel reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86\n processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local\n user permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a\n denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2022-2318](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2318)\nA use-after-free in the Amateur Radio X.25 PLP (Rose) support may\n result in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2022-2586](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2586)\nA use-after-free in the Netfilter subsystem may result in local\n privilege escalation for a user with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability\n in any user or network namespace.\n* [CVE-2022-2588](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2588)\nZhenpeng Lin discovered a use-after-free flaw in the cls\\_route\n filter implementation which may result in local privilege\n escalation for a user with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability in any\n user or network namespace.\n* [CVE-2022-2663](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2663)\nDavid Leadbeater reported flaws in the nf\\_conntrack\\_irc\n connection-tracking protocol module. When this module is enabled\n on a firewall, an external user on the same IRC network as an\n internal user could exploit its lax parsing to open arbitrary TCP\n ports in the firewall, to reveal their public IP address, or to\n block their IRC connection at the firewall.\n* [CVE-2022-3028](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3028)\nAbhishek Shah reported a race condition in the AF\\_KEY subsystem,\n which could lead to an out-of-bounds write or read. A local user\n could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n corruption), to obtain sensitive information, or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-26365](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26365), [CVE-2022-33740](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-33740), [CVE-2022-33741](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-33741), [CVE-2022-33742](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-33742)\nRoger Pau Monne discovered that Xen block and network PV device\n frontends don't zero out memory regions before sharing them with\n the backend, which may result in information disclosure.\n Additionally it was discovered that the granularity of the grant\n table doesn't permit sharing less than a 4k page, which may also\n result in information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2022-26373](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26373)\nIt was discovered that on certain processors with Intel's Enhanced\n Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) capabilities there\n are exceptions to the documented properties in some situations,\n which may result in information disclosure.\n\n\nIntel's explanation of the issue can be found at\n <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/post-barrier-return-stack-buffer-predictions.html>\n* [CVE-2022-33744](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-33744)\nOleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that ARM Xen guests can cause a\n denial of service to the Dom0 via paravirtual devices.\n* [CVE-2022-36879](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-36879)\nA flaw was discovered in xfrm\\_expand\\_policies in the xfrm\n subsystem which can cause a reference count to be dropped twice.\n* [CVE-2022-36946](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-36946)\nDomingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera reported a memory\n corruption flaw in the Netfilter subsystem which may result in\n denial of service.\n* [CVE-2022-39188](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39188)\nJann Horn reported a race condition in the kernel's handling of\n unmapping of certain memory ranges. When a driver created a\n memory mapping with the VM\\_PFNMAP flag, which many GPU drivers do,\n the memory mapping could be removed and freed before it was\n flushed from the CPU TLBs. This could result in a page\n useâafter-free. A local user with access to such a device could\n exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-39842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39842)\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the pxa3xx-gcu video driver\n which could lead to a heap out-of-bounds write.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2022-40307](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-40307)\nA race condition was discovered in the EFI capsule-loader driver,\n which could lead to use-after-free. A local user permitted to\n access this device (/dev/efi\\_capsule\\_loader) could exploit this to\n cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly\n for privilege escalation. However, this device is normally only\n accessible by the root user.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.19.260-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
