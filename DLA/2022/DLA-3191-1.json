This may lead to a cross-site\n scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n* [CVE-2022-23833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23833)\nThe HTTP MultiPartParser had a issue whereby certain inputs to multipart\n forms could result in an infinite loop when parsing uploaded\n files.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.11.29-1+deb10u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
