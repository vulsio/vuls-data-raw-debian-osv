	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Git, a fast, scalable,\ndistributed revision control system, which may affect multi-user systems.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-21300](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-21300)\nA specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as\n files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may cause just-checked\n out script to be executed while cloning onto a case-insensitive file system\n such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the default file systems on Windows and\n macOS).\n* [CVE-2021-40330](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-40330)\ngit\\_connect\\_git in connect.c allows a repository path to contain a newline\n character, which may result in unexpected cross-protocol requests, as\n demonstrated by the git://localhost:1234/%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/%20HTTP/1.1\n substring.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:2.20.1-2+deb10u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your git packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of git please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/git>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
