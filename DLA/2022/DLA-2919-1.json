	"details": "\nTwo issues have been discovered in python2.7:\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-3177](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3177)\nPython has a buffer overflow in PyCArg\\_repr in \\_ctypes/callproc.c, which may\n lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept\n floating-point numbers as untrusted input.\n* [CVE-2021-4189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4189)\nA flaw was found in Python, specifically in the FTP (File Transfer Protocol)\n client library when using it in PASV (passive) mode. The flaw lies in how\n the FTP client trusts the host from PASV response by default. An attacker\n could use this flaw to setup a malicious FTP server that can trick FTP\n clients into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This could lead\n to FTP client scanning ports which otherwise would not have been possible.\n .\n Instead of using the returned address, ftplib now uses the IP address we're\n already connected to. For the rare user who wants an old behavior, set a\n `trust\\_server\\_pasv\\_ipv4\\_address` attribute on your `ftplib.FTP` instance to\n True.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.7.13-2+deb9u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python2.7 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python2.7>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
