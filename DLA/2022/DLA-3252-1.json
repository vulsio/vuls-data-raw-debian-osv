	"details": "\nMultiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in cacti, a web\ninterface for graphing of monitoring systems, which may result in\ninformation disclosure, authentication bypass, or remote code execution.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-8813](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8813)\nAskar discovered that an authenticated guest user with the graph\n real-time privilege could execute arbitrary code on a server running\n Cacti, via shell meta-characters in a cookie.\n* [CVE-2020-23226](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-23226)\nJing Chen discovered multiple Cross Site Scripting (XSS)\n vulnerabilities in several pages, which can lead to information\n disclosure.\n* [CVE-2020-25706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25706)\njoelister discovered an Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in\n templates\\_import.php, which can lead to information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2022-0730](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0730)\nIt has been discovered that Cacti authentication can be bypassed\n when LDAP anonymous binding is enabled.\n* [CVE-2022-46169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-46169)\nStefan Schiller discovered a command injection vulnerability,\n allowing an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a\n server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected (which\n is likely the case on a production instance) for any monitored\n device.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.2.2+ds1-2+deb10u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of cacti please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cacti>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
