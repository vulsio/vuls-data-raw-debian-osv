	"details": "\nJakub Wilk discovered a local privilege escalation in needrestart, a\nutility to check which daemons need to be restarted after library\nupgrades. Regular expressions to detect the Perl, Python, and Ruby\ninterpreters are not anchored, allowing a local user to escalate\nprivileges when needrestart tries to detect if interpreters are using\nold source files.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.11-3+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your needrestart packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of needrestart please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/needrestart>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
