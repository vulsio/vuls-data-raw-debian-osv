	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in lrzip, a\ncompression program. Invalid pointers, use-after-free and infinite\nloops would allow attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly\nother unspecified impact via a crafted compressed file.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-5786](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5786)\nThere is an infinite loop and application hang in the get\\_fileinfo\n function (lrzip.c). Remote attackers could leverage this\n vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted lrz file.\n* [CVE-2020-25467](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25467)\nA null pointer dereference was discovered lzo\\_decompress\\_buf in\n stream.c which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service\n (DOS) via a crafted compressed file.\n* [CVE-2021-27345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27345)\nA null pointer dereference was discovered in ucompthread in\n stream.c which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS)\n via a crafted compressed file.\n* [CVE-2021-27347](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27347)\nUse after free in lzma\\_decompress\\_buf function in stream.c in\n allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted\n compressed file.\n* [CVE-2022-26291](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26291)\nlrzip was discovered to contain a multiple concurrency\n use-after-free between the functions zpaq\\_decompress\\_buf() and\n clear\\_rulist(). This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a\n Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted lrz file.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.631-1+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lrzip packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of lrzip please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/lrzip>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
