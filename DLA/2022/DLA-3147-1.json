	"summary": "twig - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential arbitrary file read\nvulnerability in twig, a PHP templating library. It was caused by insufficient\nvalidation of template names in 'source' and 'include' statements.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-39261](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39261)\nTwig is a template language for PHP. Versions 1.x prior to 1.44.7, 2.x\n prior to 2.15.3, and 3.x prior to 3.4.3 encounter an issue when the\n filesystem loader loads templates for which the name is a user input. It is\n possible to use the `source` or `include` statement to read arbitrary files\n from outside the templates' directory when using a namespace like\n `@somewhere/../some.file`. In such a case, validation is bypassed. Versions\n 1.44.7, 2.15.3, and 3.4.3 contain a fix for validation of such template\n names. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.6.2-2+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your twig packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
