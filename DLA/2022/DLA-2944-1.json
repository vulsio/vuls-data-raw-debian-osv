A value of 0xffffffff in the name\n length field will cause a zero-sized buffer to be allocated for the name,\n resulting in a write to a dangling pointer. This issue exists for the\n NBD\\_OPT\\_INFO, NBD\\_OPT\\_GO, and NBD\\_OPT\\_EXPORT\\_NAME messages.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:3.15.2-3+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nbd packages.\n\n\nThanks to Wouter Verhelst for help in preparing this update.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
