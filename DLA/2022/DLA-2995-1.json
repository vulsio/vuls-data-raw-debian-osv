	"summary": "smarty3 - security update",
	"details": "\nSmarty3, a template engine for PHP, allowed template authors to run restricted\nstatic php methods. The same authors could also run arbitrary PHP code by\ncrafting a malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user\nprovided data to the math function, remote users were able to run arbitrary PHP\ncode as well.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.1.31+20161214.1.c7d42e4+selfpack1-2+deb9u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your smarty3 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of smarty3 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/smarty3>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
