	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-3640](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3640)\nLinMa of BlockSec Team discovered a race condition in the\n Bluetooth SCO implementation that can lead to a use-after-free. A\n local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory\n corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-3752](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3752)\nLikang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the\n Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.\n A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service\n (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-4002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4002)\nIt was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by\n applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the\n CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary. In some\n circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge\n pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.\n This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or\n information leaks.\n* [CVE-2021-4083](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4083)\nJann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets\n garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free. A local user\n could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption\n or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-4155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4155)\nKirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS\\_IOC\\_ALLOCSP\n IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files\n with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this\n flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.\n* [CVE-2021-4202](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4202)\nLin Ma discovered a race condition in the NCI (NFC Controller\n Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local\n user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory\n corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n\n\nThis protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2021-28711](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28711)\n, [CVE-2021-28712](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28712), [CVE-2021-28713](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28713) (XSA-391)\n\n\nJuergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial\n of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high\n frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less\n privileged environment.\n* [CVE-2021-28714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28714)\n, [CVE-2021-28715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28715) (XSA-392)\n\n\nJuergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux\n netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in\n denial of service.\n* [CVE-2021-29264](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-29264)\nIt was discovered that the gianfar Ethernet driver used with\n some Freescale SoCs did not correctly handle a Rx queue overrun\n when jumbo packets were enabled. On systems using this driver and\n jumbo packets, an attacker on the network could exploit this to\n cause a denial of service (crash).\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2021-33033](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33033)\nThe syzbot tool found a reference counting bug in the CIPSO\n implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.\n\n\nThis protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2021-39685](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39685)\nSzymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the\n USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of\n service or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-39686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39686)\nA race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that\n could lead to incorrect security checks. On systems where the\n binder driver is loaded, a local user could exploit this for\n privilege escalation.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2021-39698](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39698)\nLinus Torvalds reported a flaw in the file polling implementation,\n which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit\n this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-39714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39714)\nA potential reference count overflow was found in the Android Ion\n driver. On systems where the Ion driver is loaded, a local user\n could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or\n crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2021-43976](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43976)\nZekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the\n mwifiex\\_usb\\_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An\n attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of\n this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2021-45095](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45095)\nIt was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver\n has a reference count leak in the pep\\_sock\\_accept() function.\n* [CVE-2022-0001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0001)\n(INTEL-SA-00598)\n\n\nResearchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in\n Intel processors can be exploited to create information side channels with speculative execution. This issue is similar to\n Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some\n processors.\n\n\nThis can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a\n different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,\n or from a KVM guest to the kernel.\n* [CVE-2022-0002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0002)\n(INTEL-SA-00598)\n\n\nThis is a similar issue to [CVE-2022-0001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0001), but covers exploitation\n within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a\n sandbox to hosting code in the same process.\n\n\nThis can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged\n users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged\\_bpf\\_disabled=2. This\n update does that by default.\n* [CVE-2022-0330](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0330)\nSushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the\n i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-0435](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0435)\nSamuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the\n networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication\n (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the\n execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2022-0487](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0487)\nA use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller\n support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages\n as CONFIG\\_MMC\\_MOXART is not set.\n* [CVE-2022-0492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0492)\nYiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does\n not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local\n user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and\n bypass of namespace isolation.\n* [CVE-2022-0617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0617)\nbutt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF\n filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF\n image can use this flaw to crash the system.\n* [CVE-2022-24448](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24448)\nLyu Tao reported a flaw in the NFS implementation in the Linux\n kernel when handling requests to open a directory on a regular file,\n which could result in a information leak.\n* [CVE-2022-25258](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-25258)\nSzymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain\n validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory\n corruption.\n* [CVE-2022-25375](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-25375)\nSzymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation\n of the size of the RNDIS\\_MSG\\_SET command, resulting in information\n leak from kernel memory.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.9.303-1. This update additionally includes many more bug fixes from\nstable updates 4.9.291-4.9.303 inclusive.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
