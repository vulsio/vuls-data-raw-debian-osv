	"summary": "varnish - security update",
	"details": "\nMartin van Kervel Smedshammer discovered a request forgery attack can be\nperformed on Varnish Cache servers that have the HTTP/2 protocol turned on. An\nattacker may introduce characters through the HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are\ninvalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to\nproduce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This may in turn be used to\nsuccessfully exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n6.1.1-1+deb10u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your varnish packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of varnish please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/varnish>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
