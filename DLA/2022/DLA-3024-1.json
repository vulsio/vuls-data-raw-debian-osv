	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential SQL injection vulnerability in\nthe Django web development framework.\n\n\nUntrusted data was used as a tolerance parameter in GIS functions and\naggregates when using the Oracle database backend. By passing a suitably\ncrafted tolerance to GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle, it was potentially\npossible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-9402](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9402)\nDjango 1.11 before 1.11.29, 2.2 before 2.2.11, and 3.0 before 3.0.4\n allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a tolerance parameter\n in GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle. By passing a suitably\n crafted tolerance to GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle, it was\n possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.10.7-2+deb9u17.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
