	"details": "\nFelix Wilhelm discovered that libxml2, the GNOME XML library, did not correctly\ncheck for integer overflows or used wrong types for buffer sizes. This could\nresult in out-of-bounds writes or other memory errors when working on large,\nmulti-gigabyte buffers.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libxml2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxml2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
