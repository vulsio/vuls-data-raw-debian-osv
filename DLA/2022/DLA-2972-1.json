	"details": "\nFive security issues have been discovered in libxml2: XML C parser and toolkit.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-9318](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9318)\nVulnerable versions do not offer a flag directly indicating that the current\n document may be read but other files may not be opened, which makes it\n easier for remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via\n a crafted document.\n* [CVE-2017-5130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5130)\nInteger overflow in memory debug code, allowed a remote attacker to\n potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted XML file.\n* [CVE-2017-5969](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5969)\nParser in a recover mode allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted XML document.\n* [CVE-2017-16932](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16932)\nWhen expanding a parameter entity in a DTD, infinite recursion could lead to\n an infinite loop or memory exhaustion.\n* [CVE-2022-23308](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23308)\nthe application that validates XML using xmlTextReaderRead() with\n XML\\_PARSE\\_DTDATTR and XML\\_PARSE\\_DTDVALID enabled becomes vulnerable to this\n use-after-free bug. This issue can result in denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libxml2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxml2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
