	"details": "\nMultiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache Log4j 1.2, a\nJava logging framework, when it is configured to use JMSSink, JDBCAppender,\nJMSAppender or Apache Chainsaw which could be exploited for remote code\nexecution.\n\n\nNote that a possible attacker requires write access to the Log4j configuration\nand the aforementioned features are not enabled by default. In order to\ncompletely mitigate against these type of vulnerabilities the related classes\nhave been removed from the resulting jar file.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.2.17-7+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache-log4j1.2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache-log4j1.2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache-log4j1.2>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
