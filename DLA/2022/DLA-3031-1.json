	"summary": "modsecurity-apache - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential resource exhaustion attack in\nmodsecurity-apache, an Apache module which inspects HTTP requests with the aim\nof preventing typical web application attacks such as XSS and SQL.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-42717](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-42717)\nModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.5 mishandles excessively nested JSON\n objects. Crafted JSON objects with nesting tens-of-thousands deep could\n result in the web server being unable to service legitimate requests. Even\n a moderately large (e.g., 300KB) HTTP request can occupy one of the limited\n NGINX worker processes for minutes and consume almost all of the available\n CPU on the machine. Modsecurity 2 is similarly vulnerable: the affected\n versions include 2.8.0 through 2.9.4.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.9.1-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your modsecurity-apache packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
