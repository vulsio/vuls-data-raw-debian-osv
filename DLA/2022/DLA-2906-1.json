	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there were two vulnerabilities in Django, a popular\nPython-based web development framework:\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-22818](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-22818)\nPossible XSS via {% debug %} template tag.\n\n\nThe {% debug %} template tag didn't properly encode the current context,\n posing an XSS attack vector.\n\n\nIn order to avoid this vulnerability, {% debug %} no longer outputs\n information when the DEBUG setting is False, and it ensures all context\n variables are correctly escaped when the DEBUG setting is True.\n* [CVE-2022-23833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23833)\nDenial-of-service possibility in file uploads\n\n\nPassing certain inputs to multipart forms could result in an infinite\n loop when parsing files.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.10.7-2+deb9u15.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
