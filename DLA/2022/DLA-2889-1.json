Security\nvulnerabilities leading to cross-site scripting attacks in different\ncomponents of the jQuery UI libraries were found and fixed for Drupal\nversion 7.86.\n\n\nThe fixes for said vulnerabilities were backported to the version in\nDebian 9 Stretch (7.52).\n\n\nDrupal is a rich Web content management system; it was included in\nDebian until Stretch, but is not present in any newer releases. If you\nrun a web server with Drupal7, we strongly recommend you to upgrade\nthe drupal7 package.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of drupal7 please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/drupal7>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n--AWNW9msBK4+52Jxu\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature; name=\"signature.asc\"\n\n\n",
