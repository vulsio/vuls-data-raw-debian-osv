	"details": "\nMultiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark, a network\ntraffic analyzer. An attacker could cause a denial of service (infinite loop or\napplication crash) via packet injection or a crafted capture file. Improper URL\nhandling in Wireshark could also allow remote code execution. A double-click\nwill no longer automatically open the URL in pcap(ng) files and instead copy it\nto the clipboard where it can be inspected and pasted to the browser's address\nbar.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.6.20-0+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wireshark packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of wireshark please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wireshark>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
