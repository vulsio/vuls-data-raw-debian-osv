	],
	"summary": "dropbear - security update",
	"details": "\nAn issue was discovered in Dropbear, a relatively small SSH server and\nclient. Due to a non-RFC-compliant check of the available authentication\nmethods in the client-side SSH code, it was possible for an SSH server\nto change the login process in its favor. This attack can bypass\nadditional security measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus,\nit allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to\nanother server unnoticed.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n2018.76-5+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dropbear packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of dropbear please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dropbear>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
