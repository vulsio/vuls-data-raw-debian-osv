	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential SQL injection vulnerability\nin libpgjava, a Java library for connecting to PostgreSQL databases.\n\n\nA malicious user could have crafted a schema that caused an application to\nexecute commands as a privileged user due to the lack of escaping of column\nnames in some operations.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-31197](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-31197)\nPostgreSQL JDBC Driver (PgJDBC for short) allows Java programs to\n connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database independent Java\n code. The PGJDBC implementation of the `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()`\n method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious column\n name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL\n injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the\n application's JDBC user. User applications that do not invoke the\n `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted. User application that do\n invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are\n querying via their JDBC application may be under the control of an\n attacker. The attack requires the attacker to trick the user into executing\n SQL against a table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL\n and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet. Note\n that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same.\n A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying database\n schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be\n vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the malicious user to\n craft a schema that causes the application to execute commands as the\n privileged user. Patched versions will be released as `42.2.26` and\n `42.4.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for\n this issue.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n42.2.5-2+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpgjava packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
