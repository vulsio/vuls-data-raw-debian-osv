	"details": "\nA security vulnerability was found in Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF\ninterpreter. It was discovered that some privileged Postscript operators\nremained accessible from various places. For instance a specially crafted\nPostScript file could use this flaw in order to have access to the file\nsystem outside of the constrains imposed by -dSAFER.\n\n\nThis problem exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2019-3839](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3839).\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n9.26a~dfsg-0+deb9u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of ghostscript please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ghostscript>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
