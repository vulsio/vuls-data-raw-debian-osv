	"details": "\nTwo security vulnerabilities were discovered in Jetty, a Java servlet engine\nand webserver.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-2047](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2047)\nIn Eclipse Jetty the parsing of the authority segment of an http scheme\n URI, the Jetty HttpURI class improperly detects an invalid input as a\n hostname. This can lead to failures in a Proxy scenario.\n* [CVE-2022-2048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2048)\nIn Eclipse Jetty HTTP/2 server implementation, when encountering an invalid\n HTTP/2 request, the error handling has a bug that can wind up not properly\n cleaning up the active connections and associated resources. This can lead\n to a Denial of Service scenario where there are no enough resources left to\n process good requests.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n9.4.16-0+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of jetty9 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jetty9>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
