	"summary": "twisted - security update",
	"details": "\nThe Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server, located in the twisted.web.http module, parsed\nseveral HTTP request constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230. This\nnon-conformant parsing can lead to desync if requests pass through multiple\nHTTP parsers, potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n16.6.0-2+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your twisted packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of twisted please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/twisted>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
