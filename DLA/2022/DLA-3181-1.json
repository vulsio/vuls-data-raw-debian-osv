	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a information disclosure utility in sudo, a\ntool used to provide limited superuser privileges to specific users. A local\nunprivileged user may have been able to perform arbitrary directory-existence\ntests by exploiting a race condition in sudoedit.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-23239](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23239)\nThe sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local\n unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning\n a sudo\\_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a\n symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.8.27-1+deb10u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
