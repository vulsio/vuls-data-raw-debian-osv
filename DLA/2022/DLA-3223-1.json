This\n will lead to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other\n impact.\n* [CVE-2019-15133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15133)\nA malformed GIF file triggers a divide-by-zero exception in the\n decoder function \n```\nDGifSlurp\n```\n in \n```\ndgif_lib.c\n```\n if the \n```\nheight\n```\n field of the\n \n```\nImageSize\n```\n data structure is equal to zero.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.1.4-3+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your giflib packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of giflib please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/giflib>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
