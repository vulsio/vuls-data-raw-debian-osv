	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there were four issues in ldns, a library used in\nDomain Name System (DNS) related programs:\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-19860](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-19860)\nWhen ldns version 1.7.1 verifies a zone file, the\n ldns\\_rr\\_new\\_frm\\_str\\_internal function has a heap out of bounds read\n vulnerability. An attacker can leak information on the heap by constructing\n a zone file payload.\n* [CVE-2020-19861](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-19861)\nWhen a zone file in ldns 1.7.1 is parsed, the function\n ldns\\_nsec3\\_salt\\_data is too trusted for the length value obtained from the\n zone file. When the memcpy is copied, the 0xfe - ldns\\_rdf\\_size(salt\\_rdf)\n byte data can be copied, causing heap overflow information\n leakage.\n* [CVE-2017-1000231](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000231)\nA double-free vulnerability in parse.c in ldns 1.7.0 have unspecified\n impact and attack vectors.\n* [CVE-2017-1000232](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000232)\nA double-free vulnerability in str2host.c in ldns 1.7.0 have unspecified\n impact and attack vectors.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these four problems have been fixed in version\n1.7.0-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ldns packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
