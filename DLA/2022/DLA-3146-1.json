	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ISC DHCP client,\nrelay and server.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-2928](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2928)\nIt was discovered that the DHCP server does not correctly perform\n option reference counting when configured with \"allow leasequery;\".\n A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial\n of service (daemon crash).\n* [CVE-2022-2929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2929)\nIt was discovered that the DHCP server is prone to a memory leak\n flaw when handling contents of option 81 (fqdn) data received in\n a DHCP packet. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw\n to cause DHCP servers to consume resources, resulting in denial\n of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.4.1-2+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of isc-dhcp please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/isc-dhcp>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
