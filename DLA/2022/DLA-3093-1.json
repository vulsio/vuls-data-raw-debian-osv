	"details": "\nThe following vulnerabilities have been discovered in rails, a ruby\nbased MVC frame work for web development.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-21831](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21831)\nA code injection vulnerability exists in the Active Storage that\n could allow an attacker to execute code via image\\_processing\n arguments.\n* [CVE-2022-22577](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-22577)\nAn XSS Vulnerability in Action Pack that could allow an attacker\n to bypass CSP for non HTML like responses.\n* [CVE-2022-23633](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23633)\nAction Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web\n requests. Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be\n closed. In the event a response is \\*not\\* notified of a `close`,\n `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local\n state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to\n subsequent requests.\n* [CVE-2022-27777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-27777)\nA XSS Vulnerability in Action View tag helpers which would allow\n an attacker to inject content if able to control input into\n specific attributes.\n* [CVE-2022-32224](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32224)\nWhen serialized columns that use YAML (the default) are\n deserialized, Rails uses YAML.unsafe\\_load to convert the YAML data\n in to Ruby objects. If an attacker can manipulate data in the\n database (via means like SQL injection), then it may be possible\n for the attacker to escalate to an RCE.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2:5.2.2.1+dfsg-1+deb10u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of rails please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rails>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
