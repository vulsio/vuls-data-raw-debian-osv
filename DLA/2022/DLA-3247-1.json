	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a potential remote denial of service\nvulnerability in node-trim-newlines, a Javascript module to strip newlines from\nthe start and/or end of a string.\n\n\nThis regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack exploited the fact\nthat most Regular Expression implementations can reach extreme situations that\ncause them to work very slowly in a way that is exponentially related to the\ninput size. An attacker can then cause a program using node-trim-newlines (and\nthus the offending regex) to enter one of these extreme situations and then\nhang for a very long time.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-33623](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33623)\nThe trim-newlines package before 3.0.1 and 4.x before 4.0.1 for Node.js\n has an issue related to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) for\n the .end() method.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.0.0-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your node-trim-newlines packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
