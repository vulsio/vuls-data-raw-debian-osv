Authenticated attackers can\n reconfigure dnsmasq via a crafted extra\\_dhcp\\_opts value.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, this has now been fixed in version\n2:9.1.1-3+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your neutron packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
