	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there were multiple vulnerabilies in Django, a\npopular Python-based development framework:\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-28346](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28346):\nAn issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.28, 3.2 before 3.2.13, and 4.0\nbefore 4.0.4. QuerySet.annotate(), aggregate(), and extra() methods are subject\nto SQL injection in column aliases via a crafted dictionary (with dictionary\nexpansion) as the passed \\*\\*kwargs.\n* [CVE-2021-45115](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45115):\nAn issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.26, 3.2 before 3.2.11, and 4.0\nbefore 4.0.1. UserAttributeSimilarityValidator incurred significant overhead in\nevaluating a submitted password that was artificially large in relation to the\ncomparison values. In a situation where access to user registration was\nunrestricted, this provided a potential vector for a denial-of-service\nattack.\n* [CVE-2021-45116](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45116):\nAn issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.26, 3.2 before 3.2.11, and 4.0\nbefore 4.0.1. Due to leveraging the Django Template Language's variable\nresolution logic, the dictsort template filter was potentially vulnerable to\ninformation disclosure, or an unintended method call, if passed a suitably\ncrafted key.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.11.29-1+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
