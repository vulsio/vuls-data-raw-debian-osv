This option specifies the tag filename. A crafted tag filename\n specified in the command line or in the configuration file results in\n arbitrary command execution because the externalSortTags() in sort.c calls\n the system(3) function in an unsafe way.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:5.9~svn20110310-12+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your exuberant-ctags packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
