The\nsmuggled request would be treated as an additional request by the Varnish\nserver which may lead to information disclosure and cache poisoning.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version\n5.0.0-7+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your varnish packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of varnish please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/varnish>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
