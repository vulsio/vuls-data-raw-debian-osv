	"details": "\nTwo issues were found in GnuTLS, a library implementing the TLS and SSL\nprotocols. A remote attacker could take advantage of these flaws to\ncause an application using the GnuTLS library to crash (denial of\nservice), or potentially, to execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.6.7-4+deb10u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of gnutls28 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/gnutls28>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
