	"summary": "bluez - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in BlueZ, the Linux Bluetooth\nprotocol stack. An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or\nleak information.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-8921](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8921)\nSDP infoleak, the vulnerability lies in the handling of a\n SVC\\_ATTR\\_REQ by the SDP implementation of BlueZ. By crafting a\n malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into\n returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in\n leaking arbitrary heap data.\n* [CVE-2019-8922](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8922)\nSDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol\n handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge\n number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow\n the static buffer provided to hold the response.\n* [CVE-2021-41229](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41229)\nsdp\\_cstate\\_alloc\\_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in\n the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will\n cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large\n object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending\n sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to\n crash.\n* [CVE-2021-43400](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43400)\nA use-after-free in gatt-database.c can occur when a client\n disconnects during D-Bus processing of a WriteValue call.\n* [CVE-2022-0204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0204)\nA heap overflow vulnerability was found in bluez. An attacker with\n local network access could pass specially crafted files causing an\n application to halt or crash, leading to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2022-39176](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39176)\nBlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive\n information because profiles/audio/avrcp.c does not validate\n params\\_len.\n* [CVE-2022-39177](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39177)\nBlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of\n service because malformed and invalid capabilities can be\n processed in profiles/audio/avdtp.c.\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n5.50-1.2~deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bluez packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of bluez please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bluez>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
