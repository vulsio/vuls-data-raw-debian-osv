	"details": "\nThe simplesamlphp package in wheezy is vulnerable to multiple attacks\non authentication-related code, leading to unauthorized access and\ninformation disclosure.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-12867](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12867)\nThe SimpleSAML\\_Auth\\_TimeLimitedToken class allows attackers with\n access to a secret token to extend its validity period by manipulating\n the prepended time offset.\n* [CVE-2017-12869](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12869)\nThe multiauth module allows remote attackers to bypass authentication\n context restrictions and use an authentication source defined in\n config/authsources.php via vectors related to improper validation of\n user input.\n* [CVE-2017-12872](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12872) /\n [CVE-2017-12868](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12868)\nThe (1) Htpasswd authentication source in the authcrypt module and (2)\n SimpleSAML\\_Session class in SimpleSAMLphp 1.14.11 and earlier allow\n remote iattackers to conduct timing side-channel attacks by leveraging\n use of the standard comparison operator to compare secret material\n against user input.\n\n\n[CVE-2017-12868](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12868) \n was a about an improper fix of [CVE-2017-12872](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12872) in the\n initial patch released by upstream. We have used the correct patch.\n* [CVE-2017-12873](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12873)\nSimpleSAMLphp might allow attackers to obtain sensitive information,\n gain unauthorized access, or have unspecified other impacts by\n leveraging incorrect persistent NameID generation when an Identity\n Provider (IdP) is misconfigured.\n* [CVE-2017-12874](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12874)\nThe InfoCard module for SimpleSAMLphp allows attackers to spoof\n XML messages by leveraging an incorrect check of return values in\n signature validation utilities.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.9.2-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your simplesamlphp packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
