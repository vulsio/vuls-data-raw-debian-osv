This is only exploitable\nif the file is also played in podbeuter.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.5-2+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your newsbeuter packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
