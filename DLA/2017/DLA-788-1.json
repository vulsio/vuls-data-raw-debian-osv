	"details": "\nFlorian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that pdns-recursor, a recursive\nDNS server, parses all records present in a query regardless of whether\nthey are needed or even legitimate, allowing a remote, unauthenticated\nattacker to cause an abnormal CPU usage load on the pdns server,\nresulting in a partial denial of service if the system becomes\noverloaded.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.3-3+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pdns-recursor packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
