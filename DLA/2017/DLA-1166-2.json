	"details": "\nA remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered in tomcat7.\n\n\nWhen HTTP PUT was enabled (e.g., via setting the readonly initialization\nparameter of the Default servlet to false) it was possible to upload a JSP\nfile to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be\nrequested and any code it contained would be executed by the server.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.0.28-4+deb7u16.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
