	"details": "\nNumerous security vulnerabilities have been found through fuzzing on\nvarious tiff-related binaries. Crafted TIFF images allows remote\nattacks to cause denial of service or, in certain cases arbitrary code\nexecution through divide-by-zero, out of bunds write, integer and heap\noverflow.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-3622](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3622)\nThe fpAcc function in tif\\_predict.c in the tiff2rgba tool in\n LibTIFF 4.0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a\n denial of service (divide-by-zero error) via a crafted TIFF image.\n* [CVE-2016-3623](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3623)\nThe rgb2ycbcr tool in LibTIFF 4.0.6 and earlier allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero) by setting\n the (1) v or (2) h parameter to 0. (Fixed along with\n [CVE-2016-3624](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3624).)\n* [CVE-2016-3624](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3624)\nThe cvtClump function in the rgb2ycbcr tool in LibTIFF 4.0.6 and\n earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (out-of-bounds write) by setting the \"-v\" option to -1.\n* [CVE-2016-3945](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3945)\nMultiple integer overflows in the (1) cvt\\_by\\_strip and (2)\n cvt\\_by\\_tile functions in the tiff2rgba tool in LibTIFF 4.0.6 and\n earlier, when -b mode is enabled, allow remote attackers to cause\n a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a\n crafted TIFF image, which triggers an out-of-bounds write.\n* [CVE-2016-3990](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3990)\nHeap-based buffer overflow in the horizontalDifference8 function\n in tif\\_pixarlog.c in LibTIFF 4.0.6 and earlier allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute\n arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image to tiffcp.\n* [CVE-2016-9533](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9533)\ntif\\_pixarlog.c in libtiff 4.0.6 has out-of-bounds write\n vulnerabilities in heap allocated buffers.

Reported as MSVR 35105, aka\n \"Predictor heap-buffer-overflow.\"\n* [CVE-2016-9536](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9536)\ntools/tiff2pdf.c in libtiff 4.0.6 has out-of-bounds write\n vulnerabilities in heap allocated buffers in\n t2p\\_process\\_jpeg\\_strip().
