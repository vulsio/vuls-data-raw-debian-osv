	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full\nvirtualization solution for Linux hosts on x86 hardware with x86 guests.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-2615](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2615)\nThe Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator in qemu-kvm is vulnerable to an\n out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA data\n via bitblt copy in backward mode.\n\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the\n Qemu process resulting in DoS OR potentially execute arbitrary\n code on the host with privileges of qemu-kvm process on the host.\n* [CVE-2017-2620](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2620)\nThe Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator in qemu-kvm is vulnerable to an\n out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA data\n in cirrus\\_bitblt\\_cputovideo.\n\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the\n Qemu process resulting in DoS OR potentially execute arbitrary\n code on the host with privileges of qemu-kvm process on the host.\n* [CVE-2017-5898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5898)\nThe CCID Card device emulator support is vulnerable to an integer\n overflow flaw. It could occur while passing message via\n command/responses packets to and from the host.\n\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the\n qemu-kvm process on the host resulting in a DoS.\n\n\nThis issue does not affect the qemu-kvm binaries in Debian but we\n apply the patch to the sources to stay in sync with the qemu\n package.\n* [CVE-2017-5973](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5973)\nThe USB xHCI controller emulator support in qemu-kvm is vulnerable\n to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing control\n transfer descriptors' sequence in xhci\\_kick\\_epctx.\n\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the\n qemu-kvm process resulting in a DoS.\n\n\nThis update also updates the fix [CVE-2016-9921](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9921)\nsince it was too strict and broke certain guests.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u20.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
