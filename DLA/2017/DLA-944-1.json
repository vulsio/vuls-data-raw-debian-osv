	"details": "\nDenial of Service due to Exhaustion of Packet-ID counter\n\n\nAn authenticated client can cause the server's the packet-id counter to\nroll over, which would lead the server process to hit an ASSERT() and\nstop running. To make the server hit the ASSERT(), the client must first\ncause the server to send it 2^32 packets (at least 196GB). \n \nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.2.1-8+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openvpn packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
