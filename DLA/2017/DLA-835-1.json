	"details": "\nDawid Golunski from legalhackers.com discovered that cakephp, an\napplication development framework for PHP, contains a vulnerability\nthat allows attackers to spoof the source IP address. It would allow\nthem to bypass access control lists, or the injection of malicious\ndata which, if treated as sanitized by an unaware CakePHP-based\napplication, can lead to other vulnerabilities such as SQL injection,\nXSS or command injection.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.3.15-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cakephp packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
