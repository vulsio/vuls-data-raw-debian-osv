	"summary": "phpmyadmin - security update",
	"details": "\nA server-side request forgery vulnerability was reported for the setup\nscript in phpmyadmin, a MYSQL web administration tool. This flaw may\nallow an unauthenticated attacker to brute-force MYSQL passwords,\ndetect internal hostnames or opened ports on the internal network.\nAdditionally there was a race condition between writing configuration\nand administrator moving it allowing unauthenticated users to read or\nalter it. Debian users who configured phpmyadmin via debconf and used\nthe default configuration for Apache 2 or Lighttpd were never affected.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4:3.4.11.1-2+deb7u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
