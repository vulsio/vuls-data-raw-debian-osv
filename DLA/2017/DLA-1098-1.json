A specially\n crafted XLS file can cause a memory corruption resulting in remote\n code execution. An attacker can send malicious XLS file to trigger\n this vulnerability.\n* [CVE-2017-2924](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2924)\nAn exploitable heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in\n the read\\_legacy\\_biff function of FreeXL 1.0.3. A specially crafted\n XLS file can cause a memory corruption resulting in remote code\n execution. An attacker can send malicious XLS file to trigger this\n vulnerability.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.0.0b-1+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your freexl packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
