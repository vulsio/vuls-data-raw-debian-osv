The related heap is\n allocated in the token() function and freed in the detoken()\n function (called by pp\\_getline()) - it is used again at multiple\n positions later that could cause multiple damages. For example,\n it causes a corrupted double-linked list in detoken(), a double\n free or corruption in delete\\_Token(), and an out-of-bounds write\n in detoken(). It has a high possibility to lead to a remote code\n execution attack.\n* [CVE-2017-11111](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11111)\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, preproc.c allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer\n overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified\n other impact via a crafted file.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.10.01-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nasm packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
