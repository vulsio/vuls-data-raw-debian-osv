	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in spice, a SPICE protocol\nclient and server library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-9577](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9577)\nFrediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered a buffer overflow\n vulnerability in the main\\_channel\\_alloc\\_msg\\_rcv\\_buf function. An\n authenticated attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a\n denial of service (spice server crash), or possibly, execute\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2016-9578](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9578)\nFrediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered that spice does not properly\n validate incoming messages. An attacker able to connect to the\n spice server could send crafted messages which would cause the\n process to crash.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.11.0-1+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
