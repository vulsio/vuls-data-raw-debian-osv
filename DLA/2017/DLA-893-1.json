The Galois/Counter mode (GCM) implementation was missing a\nboundary check that could enable a local application to gain access to\nuser's private information.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.44+dfsg-3.1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bouncycastle packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
