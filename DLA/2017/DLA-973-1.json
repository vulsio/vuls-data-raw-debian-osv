	"details": "\nTwo denial of service vulnerabilities were identified in strongSwan, an\nIKE/IPsec suite, using Google's OSS-Fuzz fuzzing project.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-9022](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9022)\nRSA public keys passed to the gmp plugin aren't validated sufficiently\n before attempting signature verification, so that invalid input might\n lead to a floating point exception and crash of the process.\n A certificate with an appropriately prepared public key sent by a peer\n could be used for a denial-of-service attack.\n* [CVE-2017-9023](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9023)\nASN.1 CHOICE types are not correctly handled by the ASN.1 parser when\n parsing X.509 certificates with extensions that use such types. This could\n lead to infinite looping of the thread parsing a specifically crafted\n certificate.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.5.2-1.5+deb7u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
