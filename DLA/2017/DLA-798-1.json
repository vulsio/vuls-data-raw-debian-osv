	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in pdns, an authoritative\nDNS server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-2120](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2120)\nMathieu Lafon discovered that pdns does not properly validate\n records in zones. An authorized user can take advantage of this flaw\n to crash server by inserting a specially crafted record in a zone\n under their control and then sending a DNS query for that record.\n* [CVE-2016-7068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7068)\nFlorian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that pdns parses all records\n present in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even\n legitimate, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause an\n abnormal CPU usage load on the pdns server, resulting in a partial\n denial of service if the system becomes overloaded.\n* [CVE-2016-7072](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7072)\nMongo discovered that the webserver in pdns is susceptible to a\n denial-of-service vulnerability. A remote, unauthenticated attacker\n to cause a denial of service by opening a large number of f TCP\n connections to the web server.\n* [CVE-2016-7073](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7073) /\n [CVE-2016-7074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7074)\nMongo discovered that pdns does not sufficiently validate TSIG\n signatures, allowing an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to\n alter the content of an AXFR.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.1-4.1+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
