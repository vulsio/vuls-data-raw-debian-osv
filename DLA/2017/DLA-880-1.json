	"details": "\ntiff3 is affected by multiple issues that can result at least in denial of\nservices of applications using libtiff4. Crafted TIFF files can be\nprovided to trigger: abort() calls via failing assertions, buffer overruns\n(both in read and write mode).\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-8781](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8781)\ntif\\_luv.c in libtiff allows attackers to cause a denial of service\n (out-of-bounds write) via an invalid number of samples per pixel in a\n LogL compressed TIFF image.\n* [CVE-2015-8782](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8782)\ntif\\_luv.c in libtiff allows attackers to cause a denial of service\n (out-of-bounds writes) via a crafted TIFF image.\n* [CVE-2015-8783](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8783)\ntif\\_luv.c in libtiff allows attackers to cause a denial of service\n (out-of-bounds reads) via a crafted TIFF image.\n* [CVE-2015-8784](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8784)\nThe NeXTDecode function in tif\\_next.c in LibTIFF allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a\n crafted TIFF image.\n* [CVE-2016-9533](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9533)\ntif\\_pixarlog.c in libtiff 4.0.6 has out-of-bounds write\n vulnerabilities in heap allocated buffers.\n* [CVE-2016-9534](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9534)\ntif\\_write.c in libtiff 4.0.6 has an issue in the error code path of\n TIFFFlushData1() that didn't reset the tif\\_rawcc and tif\\_rawcp\n members.\n* [CVE-2016-9535](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9535)\ntif\\_predict.h and tif\\_predict.c in libtiff 4.0.6 have assertions\n that can lead to assertion failures in debug mode, or buffer\n overflows in release mode, when dealing with unusual tile size\n like YCbCr with subsampling.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.9.6-11+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tiff3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
