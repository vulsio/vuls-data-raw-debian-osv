	"summary": "tiff - security update",
	"details": "\nIn LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a heap-based buffer overflow in the t2p\\_write\\_pdf\nfunction in tools/tiff2pdf.c. This heap overflow could lead to different\ndamages. For example, a crafted TIFF document can lead to an out-of-bounds read\nin TIFFCleanup, an invalid free in TIFFClose or t2p\\_free, memory corruption in\nt2p\\_readwrite\\_pdf\\_image, or a double free in t2p\\_free. Given these\npossibilities, it probably could cause arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nThis overflow is linked to an underlying assumption that all pages in a tiff\ndocument will have the same transfer function. There is nothing in the tiff\nstandard that says this needs to be the case.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.0.2-6+deb7u17.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
