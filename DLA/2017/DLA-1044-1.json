	"details": "\nThe racoon daemon in IPsec-Tools 0.8.2 and earlier contains a remotely\nexploitable computational-complexity attack when parsing and storing\nISAKMP fragments. The implementation permits a remote attacker to\nexhaust computational resources on the remote endpoint by repeatedly\nsending ISAKMP fragment packets in a particular order such that the\nworst-case computational complexity is realized in the algorithm\nutilized to determine if reassembly of the fragments can take place.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:0.8.0-14+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ipsec-tools packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
