The git-cvsserver subcommand is reachable from the\ngit-shell subcommand even if CVS support has not been configured\n(however, the git-cvs package needs to be installed).\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.7.10.4-1+wheezy6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your git packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
