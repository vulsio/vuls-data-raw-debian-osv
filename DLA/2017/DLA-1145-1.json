	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been found in zoneminder. This update\nfixes only a serious file disclosure vulnerability ([CVE-2017-5595](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5595)).\n\n\nThe application has been found to suffer from many other problems\nsuch as SQL injection vulnerabilities, cross-site scripting issues,\ncross-site request forgery, session fixation vulnerability. Due to the\namount of issues and to the relative invasiveness of the relevant patches,\nthose issues will not be fixed in Wheezy. We thus advise you to restrict\naccess to zoneminder to trusted users only. If you want to review the\nlist of ignored issues, you can check the security tracker:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/zoneminder>\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zoneminder packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these issues have been fixed in zoneminder version 1.25.0-4+deb7u2\n\n\n",
