	"details": "\nTwo significant vulnerabilities were found in the Mercurial version\ncontrol system which could lead to shell injection attacks and\nout-of-tree file overwrite.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-1000115](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000115)\nMercurial's symlink auditing was incomplete prior to 4.3, and\n could be abused to write to files outside the repository.\n* [CVE-2017-1000116](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000116)\nMercurial was not sanitizing hostnames passed to ssh, allowing\n shell injection attacks on clients by specifying a hostname\n starting with -oProxyCommand. This vulnerability is similar to\n those in Git ([CVE-2017-1000117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000117)) and Subversion \n ([CVE-2017-9800](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9800)).\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.2.2-4+deb7u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mercurial packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
