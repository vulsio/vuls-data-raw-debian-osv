	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full\nvirtualization solution for Linux hosts on x86 hardware with x86 guests\nbased on the Quick Emulator(Qemu).\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-9602](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9602)\nQuick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via\n Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper link\n following issue. It could occur while accessing symbolic link files\n on a shared host directory.\n\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to access host file\n system beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their\n privileges on a host.\n* [CVE-2017-7377](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7377)\nQuick Emulator(Qemu) built with the virtio-9p back-end support is\n vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while doing a I/O\n operation via v9fs\\_create/v9fs\\_lcreate routine.\n\n\nA privileged user/process inside guest could use this flaw to leak\n host memory resulting in Dos.\n* [CVE-2017-7471](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7471)\nQuick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via\n Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper access\n control issue. It could occur while accessing files on a shared host\n directory.\n\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to access host file\n system beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their\n privileges on a host.\n* [CVE-2017-7493](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7493)\nQuick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via\n Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper access\n control issue. It could occur while accessing virtfs metadata files\n in mapped-file security mode.\n\n\nA guest user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges inside\n guest.\n* [CVE-2017-8086](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8086)\nQuick Emulator(Qemu) built with the virtio-9p back-end support is\n vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while querying\n file system extended attributes via 9pfs\\_list\\_xattr() routine.\n\n\nA privileged user/process inside guest could use this flaw to leak\n host memory resulting in Dos.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u22.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
