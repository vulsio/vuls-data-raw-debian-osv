	"details": "\nAn attacker who is logged into OTRS, a Ticket Request System, as an\nagent with write permissions for statistics can inject arbitrary code\ninto the system. This can lead to serious problems like privilege\nescalation, data loss, and denial of service. This issue is also known\nas [CVE-2017-14635](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14635) \nand is resolved by upgrading to the latest upstream release of OTRS3.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTES**\n\n\nThis update requires manual intervention. We strongly recommend to\nbackup all files and databases before upgrading. If you use the MySQL\nbackend you should read Debian bug report #707075 and the included\nREADME.Debian file which will provide further information.\n\n\nIf you discover that the maintenance mode is still activated after the\nupdate, we recommend to remove /etc/otrs/maintenance.html and\n/var/lib/otrs/httpd/htdocs/maintenance.html which will resolve the issue.\n\n\nIn addition the following security vulnerabilities were also addressed:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-1695](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1695)\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OTRS allows remote\n attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted HTML\n email\n* [CVE-2014-2553](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2553)\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OTRS allows remote\n authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via\n vectors related to dynamic fields\n* [CVE-2014-2554](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2554)\nOTRS allows remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via an\n IFRAME element\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.3.18-1~deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your otrs2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
