	"details": "\nThe scp\\_v0s\\_accept function in sesman/libscp/libscp\\_v0.c in the session manager\nin xrdp uses an untrusted integer as a write length, which allows local users\nto cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or\npossibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted input stream.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.5.0-2+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xrdp packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
