	"details": "\nIt was discovered that logback, a flexible logging library for Java,\nwould deserialize data from untrusted sockets which may lead to the\nexecution of arbitrary code. This issue has been resolved by adding a\nwhitelist to use only trusted classes.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.0.4-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your logback packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
