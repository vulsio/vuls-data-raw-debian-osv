	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in kde4libs, the core libraries\nfor all KDE 4 applications. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-6410](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6410)\nItzik Kotler, Yonatan Fridburg and Amit Klein of Safebreach Labs\n reported that URLs are not sanitized before passing them to\n FindProxyForURL, potentially allowing a remote attacker to obtain\n sensitive information via a crafted PAC file.\n* [CVE-2017-8422](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8422)\nSebastian Krahmer from SUSE discovered that the KAuth framework\n contains a logic flaw in which the service invoking dbus is not\n properly checked. This flaw allows spoofing the identity of the\n caller and gaining root privileges from an unprivileged account.\n* [CVE-2013-2074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2074)\nIt was discovered that KIO would show web authentication\n credentials in some error cases.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4:4.8.4-4+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kde4libs packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
