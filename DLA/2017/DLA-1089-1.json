When receiving messages with\n invalid time stamps, Irssi would try to dereference a NULL pointer.\n* [CVE-2017-10966](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10966)\nAn issue was discovered in Irssi before 1.0.4. While updating the internal\n nick list, Irssi could incorrectly use the GHashTable interface and free\n the nick while updating it. This would then result in use-after-free\n conditions on each access of the hash table.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.8.15-5+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your irssi packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
