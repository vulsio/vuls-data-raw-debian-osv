	"details": "\nIt was discovered that icu, the International Components for Unicode\nlibrary, did not correctly validate its input. An attacker could use\nthis problem to trigger an out-of-bound write through a heap-based\nbuffer overflow, thus causing a denial of service via application\ncrash, or potential execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.8.1.1-12+deb7u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your icu packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
