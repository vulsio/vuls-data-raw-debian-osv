	"details": "\nTwo security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat\nservlet and JSP engine.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-5647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5647)\nA bug in the handling of the pipelined requests when send file was\n used resulted in the pipelined request being lost when send file\n processing of the previous request completed. This could result in\n responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request.\n* [CVE-2017-5648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5648)\nIt was noticed that some calls to application listeners did not use\n the appropriate facade object. When running an untrusted application\n under a SecurityManager, it was therefore possible for that\n untrusted application to retain a reference to the request or\n response object and thereby access and/or modify information\n associated with another web application.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.0.28-4+deb7u12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
