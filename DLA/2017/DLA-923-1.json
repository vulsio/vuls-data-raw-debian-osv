	"details": "\nIt was discovered that partclone, an utility to backup partitions,\nwas prone to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to\ninsufficient validation of the partclone image header. This could allow\nremote attackers to cause a Denial of Service attack in the context\nof the user running the affected application via a crafted partition\nimage.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.2.48-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your partclone packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
