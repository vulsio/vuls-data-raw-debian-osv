While the application has been fixed to set\nproper permissions by default, you still have to manually fix\nthe permissions on any existing file.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.15-2+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
