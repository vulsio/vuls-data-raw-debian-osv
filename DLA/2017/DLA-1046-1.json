	"summary": "lucene-solr - security update",
	"details": "\nlucene-solr handler supports an HTTP API (/replication?command=filecontent&file=<file\\_name>)\nwhich is vulnerable to path traversal attack. Specifically, this API does not\nperform any validation of the user specified file\\_name parameter. This can\nallow an attacker to download any file readable to Solr server process even if\nit is not related to the actual Solr index state.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.6.0+dfsg-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lucene-solr packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
