	"summary": "smb4k - security update",
	"details": "\nSebastian Krahmer from SUSE discovered that smb4k, a Samba (SMB) share\nadvanced browser, contains a logic flaw in which the mount helper binary\ndoes not properly verify the mount command it is being asked to run.\n\n\nThis allows local users to call any other binary as root.\n\n\nThe issue is resolved by backporting version 1.2.1-2 from Debian 9\nStretch.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.2.1-2~deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your smb4k packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
