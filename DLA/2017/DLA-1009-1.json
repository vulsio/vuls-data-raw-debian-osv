	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-3167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3167)\nEmmanuel Dreyfus reported that the use of ap\\_get\\_basic\\_auth\\_pw() by\n third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to\n authentication requirements being bypassed.\n* [CVE-2017-3169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3169)\nVasileios Panopoulos of AdNovum Informatik AG discovered that\n mod\\_ssl may dereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call\n ap\\_hook\\_process\\_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port\n leading to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-7668](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7668)\nJavier Jimenez reported that the HTTP strict parsing contains a flaw\n leading to a buffer overread in ap\\_find\\_token(). A remote attacker\n can take advantage of this flaw by carefully crafting a sequence of\n request headers to cause a segmentation fault, or to force\n ap\\_find\\_token() to return an incorrect value.\n* [CVE-2017-7679](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7679)\nChenQin and Hanno Boeck reported that mod\\_mime can read one byte\n past the end of a buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type\n response header.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.2.22-13+deb7u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
