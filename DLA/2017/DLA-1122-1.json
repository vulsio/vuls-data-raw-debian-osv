	"summary": "asterisk - security update",
	"details": "\nA security vulnerability was discovered in Asterisk, an Open\nSource PBX and telephony toolkit, that may lead to unauthorized\ncommand execution.\n\n\nThe app\\_minivm module has an externnotify program configuration option\nthat is executed by the MinivmNotify dialplan application. The\napplication uses the caller-id name and number as part of a built\nstring passed to the OS shell for interpretation and execution. Since\nthe caller-id name and number can come from an untrusted source, a\ncrafted caller-id name or number allows an arbitrary shell command\ninjection.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.8.13.1~dfsg1-3+deb7u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
