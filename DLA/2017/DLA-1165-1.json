Any user with a valid password but with deactivated or\ndisabled account was able to log in.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.4-2+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpam4j packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
