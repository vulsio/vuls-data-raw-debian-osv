	"details": "\nThe cPanel Security Team discovered several security vulnerabilities in\ncgiemail, a CGI program used to create HTML forms for sending mails:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-5613](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5613)\nA format string injection vulnerability allowed to supply arbitrary\n format strings to cgiemail and cgiecho. A local attacker with\n permissions to provide a cgiemail template could use this\n vulnerability to execute code as webserver user.\n Format strings in cgiemail tempaltes are now restricted to simple\n %s, %U and %H sequences.\n* [CVE-2017-5614](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5614)\nAn open redirect vulnerability in cgiemail and cgiecho binaries\n could be exploited by a local attacker to force redirect to an\n arbitrary URL. These redirects are now limited to the domain that\n handled the request.\n* [CVE-2017-5615](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5615)\nA vulnerability in cgiemail and cgiecho binaries allowed injection\n of additional HTTP headers. Newline characters are now stripped\n from the redirect location to protect against this.\n* [CVE-2017-5616](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5616)\nMissing escaping of the addendum parameter lead to a reflected\n cross-site (XSS) vulnerability in cgiemail and cgiecho binaries.\n The output is now html escaped.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.6-37+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cgiemail packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
