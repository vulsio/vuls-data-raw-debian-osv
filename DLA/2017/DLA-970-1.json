	"summary": "sudo - security update",
	"details": "\nThe Qualys Security team discovered that sudo, a program designed to\nprovide limited super user privileges to specific users, does not\nproperly parse \"/proc/[pid]/stat\" to read the device number of the tty\nfrom field 7 (tty\\_nr). A sudoers user can take advantage of this flaw on\nan SELinux-enabled system to obtain full root privileges.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.8.5p2-1+nmu3+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.8.10p3-1+deb8u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
