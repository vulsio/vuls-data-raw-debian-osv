	"details": "\nMaor Shwartz, Jeremy Heng and Terry Chia discovered two security\nvulnerabilities in Graphicsmagick, a collection of image processing tool\ns.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-16352](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16352)\nGraphicsmagick was vulnerable to a heap-based buffer\n overflow vulnerability found in the Display visual image directory\n feature of the DescribeImage() function of the magick/describe.c\n file. One possible way to trigger the vulnerability is to run the\n identify command on a specially crafted MIFF format file with the\n verbose flag.\n* [CVE-2017-16353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16353)\nGraphicsmagick was vulnerable to a memory information disclosure\n vulnerability found in the DescribeImage function of the\n magick/describe.c file, because of a heap-based buffer over-read. The\n portion of the code containing the vulnerability is responsible for\n printing the IPTC Profile information contained in the image. This\n vulnerability can be triggered with a specially crafted MIFF file.\n There is an out-of-bounds buffer dereference because certain\n increments are never checked.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.3.16-1.1+deb7u13.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
