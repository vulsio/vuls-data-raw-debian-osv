Furthermore, while the current\nversion in Debian was already patched for \\_TIFFVGetField issues\n([CVE-2016-10095](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10095), \n[CVE-2017-9147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9147)), \nwe replaced our Debian-specific patches\nby the upstream provided patches to stay closer to upstream.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.0.2-6+deb7u14.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
