The command line tools is e.g. used in KDE's\n metadataparsing.\n* [CVE-2017-5331](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5331)\nIt turned out that the correction for [CVE-2017-5208](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5208) was not enough\n so an additional correction was needed.\n* [CVE-2017-5332](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5332)\nBut as I see it there are still combinations of the arguments which\n make the test succeed even though the the memory block identified by\n offset size is not fully inside memory total\\_size.\n* [CVE-2017-5333](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5333)\nThe memory check was not stringent enough on 64 bit systems.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.29.1-5deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your icoutils packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
