	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-7482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7482)\nShi Lei discovered that RxRPC Kerberos 5 ticket handling code does\n not properly verify metadata, leading to information disclosure,\n denial of service or potentially execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-7542](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7542)\nAn integer overflow vulnerability in the ip6\\_find\\_1stfragopt()\n function was found allowing a local attacker with privileges to open\n raw sockets to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-7889](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7889)\nTommi Rantala and Brad Spengler reported that the mm subsystem does\n not properly enforce the CONFIG\\_STRICT\\_DEVMEM protection mechanism,\n allowing a local attacker with access to /dev/mem to obtain\n sensitive information or potentially execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-10661](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10661)\nDmitry Vyukov of Google reported that the timerfd facility does\n not properly handle certain concurrent operations on a single file\n descriptor. This allows a local attacker to cause a denial of\n service or potentially to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-10911](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10911) / XSA-216\n\n Anthony Perard of Citrix discovered an information leak flaw in Xen\n blkif response handling, allowing a malicious unprivileged guest to\n obtain sensitive information from the host or other guests.\n* [CVE-2017-11176](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11176)\nIt was discovered that the mq\\_notify() function does not set the\n sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. An attacker\n can take advantage of this flaw during a userspace close of a\n Netlink socket to cause a denial of service or potentially cause\n other impact.\n* [CVE-2017-11600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11600)\nbo Zhang reported that the xfrm subsystem does not properly\n validate one of the parameters to a netlink message. Local users\n with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability can use this to cause a denial\n of service or potentially to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-12134](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12134) / #866511 / XSA-229\n\n Jan H. SchĂśnherr of Amazon discovered that when Linux is running\n in a Xen PV domain on an x86 system, it may incorrectly merge\n block I/O requests. A buggy or malicious guest may trigger this\n bug in dom0 or a PV driver domain, causing a denial of service or\n potentially execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nThis issue can be mitigated by disabling merges on the underlying\n back-end block devices, e.g.:\n echo 2 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nomerges\n* [CVE-2017-12153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12153)\nbo Zhang reported that the cfg80211 (wifi) subsystem does not\n properly validate the parameters to a netlink message. Local users\n with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability on a system with a wifi device\n can use this to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-12154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12154)\nJim Mattson of Google reported that the KVM implementation for\n Intel x86 processors did not correctly handle certain nested\n hypervisor configurations. A malicious guest (or nested guest in a\n suitable L1 hypervisor) could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-14106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14106)\nAndrey Konovalov of Google reported that a specific sequence of\n operations on a TCP socket could lead to division by zero. A\n local user could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-14140](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14140)\nOtto Ebeling reported that the move\\_pages() system call permitted\n users to discover the memory layout of a set-UID process running\n under their real user-ID. This made it easier for local users to\n exploit vulnerabilities in programs installed with the set-UID\n permission bit set.\n* [CVE-2017-14156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14156)\nsohu0106 reported an information leak in the atyfb video driver.\n A local user with access to a framebuffer device handled by this\n driver could use this to obtain sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2017-14340](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14340)\nRichard Wareing discovered that the XFS implementation allows the\n creation of files with the realtime flag on a filesystem with no\n realtime device, which can result in a crash (oops). A local user\n with access to an XFS filesystem that does not have a realtime\n device can use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-14489](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14489)\nChunYu of Red Hat discovered that the iSCSI subsystem does not\n properly validate the length of a netlink message, leading to\n memory corruption. A local user with permission to manage iSCSI\n devices can use this for denial of service or possibly to\n execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-1000111](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000111)\nAndrey Konovalov of Google reported that a race condition in the\n raw packet (af\\_packet) feature. Local users with the CAP\\_NET\\_RAW\n capability can use this to cause a denial of service or possibly to\n execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-1000251](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000251) / #875881\n\n Armis Labs discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem does not\n properly validate L2CAP configuration responses, leading to a\n stack buffer overflow. This is one of several vulnerabilities\n dubbed Blueborne. A nearby attacker can use this to cause a\n denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code on a\n system with Bluetooth enabled.\n* [CVE-2017-1000363](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000363)\nRoee Hay reported that the lp driver does not properly bounds-check\n passed arguments. This has no security impact in Debian.\n* [CVE-2017-1000365](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000365)\nIt was discovered that argument and environment pointers are not\n properly taken into account by the size restrictions on arguments\n and environmental strings passed through execve(). A local\n attacker can take advantage of this flaw in conjunction with other\n flaws to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-1000380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000380)\nAlexander Potapenko of Google reported a race condition in the ALSA\n (sound) timer driver, leading to an information leak. A local user\n with permission to access sound devices could use this to obtain\n sensitive information.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.2.93-1. This version also includes bug fixes from upstream versions\nup to and including 3.2.93.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.16.43-2+deb8u4 or were fixed in an earlier version.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.9.30-2+deb9u4 or were fixed in an earlier version.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
