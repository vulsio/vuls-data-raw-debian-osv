	"details": "\nAn erlang TLS server configured with cipher suites using RSA key exchange,\nmay be vulnerable to an Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext attack (AKA\nBleichenbacher attack) against RSA, which when exploited, may result in\nplaintext recovery of encrypted messages and/or a Man-in-the-middle (MiTM)\nattack, despite the attacker not having gained access to the server's\nprivate key itself.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n15.b.1-dfsg-4+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your erlang packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
