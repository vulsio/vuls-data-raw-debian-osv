This has been restricted to a small set of programs since a\nlong time ago.\n\n\nUnfortunately it turned out that one program in the list, mpost, allows\nin turn to specify other programs to be run, which allows arbitrary code\nexecution when compiling a TeX document.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2012.20120611-5+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your texlive-base packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
