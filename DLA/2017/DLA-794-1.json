	"summary": "groovy - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was found that a flaw in Apache Groovy, a dynamic language for the\nJava Virtual Machine, allows remote code execution wherever\ndeserialization occurs in the application. It is possible for an\nattacker to craft a special serialized object that will execute code\ndirectly when deserialized. All applications which rely on\nserialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects\nare subject to this vulnerability.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.8.6-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your groovy packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
