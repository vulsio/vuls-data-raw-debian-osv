	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in\nlibcamunrar, a library to add unrar support to the Clam anti-virus software.\n\n\nThis was caused by an integer overflow resulting in a negative value of the\n``DestPos`` variable, which allows the attacker to write out of bounds when\nsetting ``Mem[DestPos]``.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this issue has been fixed in libclamunrar version\n0.99-0+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libclamunrar packages.\n\n\n",
