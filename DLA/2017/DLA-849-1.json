	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or have other\nimpacts.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-9588](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9588)\nJim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel x86\n processors does not properly handle #BP and #OF exceptions in an\n L2 (nested) virtual machine. A local attacker in an L2 guest VM\n can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service for\n the L1 guest VM.\n* [CVE-2017-2636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2636)\nAlexander Popov discovered a race condition flaw in the n\\_hdlc\n line discipline that can lead to a double free. A local\n unprivileged user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege\n escalation. On systems that do not already have the n\\_hdlc module\n loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:\n echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-n\\_hdlc.conf install n\\_hdlc false\n* [CVE-2017-5669](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5669)\nGareth Evans reported that privileged users can map memory at\n address 0 through the shmat() system call. This could make it\n easier to exploit other kernel security vulnerabilities via a\n set-UID program.\n* [CVE-2017-5986](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5986)\nAlexander Popov reported a race condition in the SCTP\n implementation that can be used by local users to cause a\n denial-of-service (crash). The initial fix for this was incorrect\n and introduced further security issues ([CVE-2017-6353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6353)). This\n update includes a later fix that avoids those. On systems that do\n not already have the sctp module loaded, this can be mitigated by\n disabling it:\n echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-sctp.conf install sctp false\n* [CVE-2017-6214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6214)\nDmitry Vyukov reported a bug in the TCP implementation's handling\n of urgent data in the splice() system call. This can be used by a\n remote attacker for denial-of-service (hang) against applications\n that read from TCP sockets with splice().\n* [CVE-2017-6345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6345)\nAndrey Konovalov reported that the LLC type 2 implementation\n incorrectly assigns socket buffer ownership. This might be usable\n by a local user to cause a denial-of-service (memory corruption or\n crash) or privilege escalation. On systems that do not already have\n the llc2 module loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:\n echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-llc2.conf install llc2 false\n* [CVE-2017-6346](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6346)\nDmitry Vyukov reported a race condition in the raw packet (af\\_packet)\n fanout feature. Local users with the CAP\\_NET\\_RAW capability (in any\n user namespace) can use this for denial-of-service and possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2017-6348](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6348)\nDmitry Vyukov reported that the general queue implementation in\n the IrDA subsystem does not properly manage multiple locks,\n possibly allowing local users to cause a denial-of-service\n (deadlock) via crafted operations on IrDA devices.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.2.86-1.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.16.39-1+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
