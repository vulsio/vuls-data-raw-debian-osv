The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-17405](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17405)\nA command injection vulnerability in Net::FTP might allow a\n malicious FTP server the execution of arbitrary commands.\n* [CVE-2017-17790](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17790)\nA command injection vulnerability in lib/resolv.rb's lazy\\_initialze\n might allow a command injection attack. However untrusted input to\n this function is rather unlikely.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.8.7.358-7.1+deb7u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.8 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
