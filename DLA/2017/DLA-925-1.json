	"details": "\nAn information disclosure vulnerability was found in kedpm, a password\nmanager compatible with the figaro password manager file format. The\nhistory file can reveal the master password if it is provided on the\ncommandline. The name of entries created or read in the password\nmanager are also exposed in the history file.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, the master password disclosure issue has been\nfixed in version 0.5.0-4+deb7u1. The entries issues has not been fixed\nas it requires a rearchitecture of the software.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kedpm packages. Note that kedpm has\nbeen removed from the upcoming Debian release (\"stretch\") and you\nshould migrate to another password manager as kedpm was abandoned.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
