	"details": "\nIt was discovered that sam2p, a utility to convert raster images and\nother image formats, was affected by an integer overflow vulnerability\nwith resultant heap-based buffer overflow in input-bmp.ci because\nwidth and height multiplications occur unsafely. This may lead to an\napplication crash or unspecified other impact when a maliciously\ncrafted file is processed.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.49.1-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sam2p packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
