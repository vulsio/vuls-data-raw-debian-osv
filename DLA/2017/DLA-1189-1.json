The nature of the error has to do with improper handling\n of large strings with escaped characters.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.7.3-6+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
