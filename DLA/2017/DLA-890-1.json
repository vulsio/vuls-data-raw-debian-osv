	"summary": "ming - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there were multiple heap-based buffer overflows in ming,\na library to generate SWF (Flash) files.\n\n\nThe updated packages prevent a crash in the listswf utility due to a\nheap-based buffer overflow in the parseSWF\\_RGBA function and several other\nfunctions in parser.c.\n\n\nAddressSanitizer flagged them as invalid writes of size 1 but the heap could\nbe written to multiple times. The overflows are caused by a pointer behind the\nbounds of a statically allocated array of structs of type SWF\\_GRADIENTRECORD.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this issue has been fixed in ming version\n1:0.4.4-1.1+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ming packages.\n\n\n",
