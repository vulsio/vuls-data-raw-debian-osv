	"details": "\nSecunia Research has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in GnuTLS\nlibtasn1, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise\na vulnerable system.\n\n\nTwo errors in the \"asn1\\_find\\_node()\" function (lib/parser\\_aux.c)\ncan be exploited to cause a stacked-based buffer overflow.\n\n\nSuccessful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows execution\nof arbitrary code but requires tricking a user into processing\na specially crafted assignments file by e.g. asn1Coding utility.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.13-2+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
