	"summary": "qemu - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor\nemulator. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-2615](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2615)\nThe Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator in qemu is vulnerable to an\n out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA data\n via bitblt copy in backward mode.\n\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the\n Qemu process resulting in DoS OR potentially execute arbitrary\n code on the host with privileges of Qemu process on the host.\n* [CVE-2017-2620](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2620)\nThe Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator in qemu is vulnerable to an\n out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA data\n in cirrus\\_bitblt\\_cputovideo.\n\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the\n Qemu process resulting in DoS OR potentially execute arbitrary\n code on the host with privileges of Qemu process on the host.\n* [CVE-2017-5898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5898)\nThe CCID Card device emulator support is vulnerable to an integer\n overflow flaw. It could occur while passing message via\n command/responses packets to and from the host.\n\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the\n Qemu process on host resulting in DoS.\n* [CVE-2017-5973](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5973)\nThe USB xHCI controller emulator support in qemu is vulnerable\n to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing control\n transfer descriptors' sequence in xhci\\_kick\\_epctx.\n\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the\n Qemu process resulting in DoS.\n\n\nThis update also updates the fix [CVE-2016-9921](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9921) \nsince it was too strict and broke certain guests.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u20.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
