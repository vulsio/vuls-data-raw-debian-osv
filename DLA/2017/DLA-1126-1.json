The rest of the\n matching then read invalid memory.\n* [CVE-2017-13722](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13722)\nA malformed PCF file could cause the library to make\n reads from random heap memory that was behind the `strings` buffer,\n leading to an application crash or a information leak.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this issue has been fixed in libxfont version\n1:1.4.5-5+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxfont packages.\n\n\n",
