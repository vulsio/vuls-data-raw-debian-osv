	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an out-of-bounds memory vulnerability\nin apr, a support/portability library for various applications.\n\n\nWhen the apr\\_exp\\_time\\*() or apr\\_os\\_exp\\_time\\*() functions were invoked\nwith an invalid month field value, out of bounds memory may have been be\naccessed when converting this value to an apr\\_time\\_exp\\_t value. This\ncould have potentially revealed the contents of a different static heap\nvalue or resulted in program termination.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, this issue has been fixed in apr version\n1.4.6-3+deb7u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apr packages.\n\n\n",
