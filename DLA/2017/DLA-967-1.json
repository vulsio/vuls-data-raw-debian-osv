	"summary": "gajim - security update",
	"details": "\nGajim implements XEP-0146, an XMPP extension to run commands remotely\nfrom another client. However it was found that malicious servers can\ntrigger commands, which could lead to leaking private conversations\nfrom encrypted sessions. To solve this, XEP-0146 support has been\ndisabled by default.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.15.1-4.1+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gajim packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
