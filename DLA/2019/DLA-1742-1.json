An attacker with author privileges\n can execute arbitrary code by uploading a crafted image containing\n PHP code in the Exif metadata.\n* [CVE-2019-9787](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9787)\nwordpress does not properly filter comment content, leading to\n Remote Code Execution by unauthenticated users in a default\n configuration. This occurs because CSRF protection is mishandled,\n and because Search Engine Optimization of A elements is performed\n incorrectly, leading to XSS. The XSS results in administrative\n access.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.1.26+dfsg-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
