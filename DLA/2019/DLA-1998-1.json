	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there were multiple double free\nvulnerabilities in python-psutil, a Python module providing\nconvenience functions for accessing system process data.\n\n\nThis was caused by incorrect reference counting handling within\nfor/while loops that convert system data into said Python objects.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-18874](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18874)\npsutil (aka python-psutil) through 5.6.5 can have a double free. This occurs because of refcount mishandling within a while or for loop that converts system data into a Python object.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.1.1-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-psutil packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
