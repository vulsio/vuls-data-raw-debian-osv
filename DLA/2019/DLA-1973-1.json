	"details": "\nA security vulnerability was discovered in libxslt, a XSLT 1.0\nprocessing library written in C.\n\n\nIn xsltCopyText in transform.c, a pointer variable is not reset under\ncertain circumstances. If the relevant memory area happened to be freed\nand reused in a certain way, a bounds check could fail and memory\noutside a buffer could be written to, or uninitialized data could be\ndisclosed.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.1.28-2+deb8u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
