	],
	"summary": "kde4libs - security update",
	"details": "\nDominik Penner discovered a flaw in how KConfig interpreted shell\ncommands in desktop files and other configuration files. An attacker may\ntrick users into installing specially crafted files which could then be\nused to execute arbitrary code, e.g. a file manager trying to find out\nthe icon for a file or any application using KConfig. Thus the entire\nfeature of supporting shell commands in KConfig entries has been\nremoved.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n4:4.14.2-5+deb8u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kde4libs packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
