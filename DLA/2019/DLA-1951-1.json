	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a denial of service vulnerability\nin the libtomcrypt cryptographic library.\n\n\nAn out-of-bounds read and crash could occur via carefully-crafted\n\"DER\" encoded data (eg. by importing an X.509 certificate).\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-17362](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17362)\nIn LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der\\_decode\\_utf8\\_string function (in der\\_decode\\_utf8\\_string.c) does not properly detect certain invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or read information from other memory locations via carefully crafted DER-encoded data.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.17-6+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libtomcrypt packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
