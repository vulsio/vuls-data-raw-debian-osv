	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a code injection issue in PyXDG, a library used to locate [freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org/) configuration/cache/etc. directories.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-12761](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12761)\nA code injection issue was discovered in PyXDG before 0.26 via crafted Python code in a Category element of a Menu XML document in a .menu file. XDG\\_CONFIG\\_DIRS must be set up to trigger xdg.Menu.parse parsing within the directory containing this file. This is due to a lack of sanitization in xdg/Menu.py before an eval call.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.25-4+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pyxdg packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
