	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was a cross-site scripting (XSS)\nvulnerability in the Django web development framework\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-12308](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12308)\nAn issue was discovered in Django 1.11 before 1.11.21, 2.1 before 2.1.9, and 2.2 before 2.2.2. The clickable Current URL value displayed by the AdminURLFieldWidget displays the provided value without validating it as a safe URL. Thus, an unvalidated value stored in the database, or a value provided as a URL query parameter payload, could result in an clickable JavaScript link.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.7.11-1+deb8u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
