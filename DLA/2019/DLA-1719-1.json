A heap-based\nbuffer over-read could be triggered by a specially-crafted bitmap\n(BMP) file.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-14498](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14498)\nget\\_8bit\\_row in rdbmp.c in libjpeg-turbo through 1.5.90 and MozJPEG through 3.3.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted 8-bit BMP in which one or more of the color indices is out of range for the number of palette entries.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.3.1-12+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libjpeg-turbo packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
