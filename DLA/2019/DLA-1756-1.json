	"summary": "libxslt - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an authentication bypass\nvulnerability in libxslt, a widely-used library for transforming\nfiles from XML to other arbitrary format.\n\n\nThe xsltCheckRead and xsltCheckWrite routines permitted access upon\nreceiving an-1 error code and (as xsltCheckRead returned -1 for a\nspecially-crafted URL that is not actually invalid) the attacker was\nsubsequently authenticated.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-11068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11068)\nlibxslt through 1.1.33 allows bypass of a protection mechanism because\n callers of xsltCheckRead and xsltCheckWrite permit access even upon\n receiving a -1 error code. xsltCheckRead can return -1 for a crafted URL\n that is not actually invalid and is subsequently loaded.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.1.28-2+deb8u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
