	"details": "\nIt has been found that the mumble-server mishandles multiple\nconcurrent requests that are persisted in the database, which allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon hang or crash)\nvia a message flood. With the new security update a rate limiter is\nadded with Leaky-Bucket algorithm.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.2.8-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mumble packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
