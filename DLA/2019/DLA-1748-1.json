	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTP server.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-0217](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0217)\nA race condition in mod\\_auth\\_digest when running in a threaded\n server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate\n using another username, bypassing configured access control\n restrictions. The issue was discovered by Simon Kappel.\n* [CVE-2019-0220](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0220)\nBernhard Lorenz of Alpha Strike Labs GmbH reported that URL\n normalizations were inconsistently handled. When the path component\n of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'),\n directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for\n duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers\n processing will implicitly collapse them.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.4.10-10+deb8u14.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
