	"summary": "clamav - regression update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that clamav, the open source antivirus engine, is affected by\nthe following security vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-12625](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12625)\nDenial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, resulting from excessively long scan\n times caused by non-recursive zip bombs. Among others, this issue was\n mitigated by introducing a scan time limit.\n* [CVE-2019-12900](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12900)\nOut-of-bounds write in ClamAV's NSIS bzip2 library when attempting\n decompression in cases where the number of selectors exceeded the max limit\n set by the library.\n\n\nThis update triggers a transition from libclamav7 to libclamav9. As a result,\nseveral other packages will be recompiled against the fixed package after the\nrelease of this update: dansguardian, havp, python-pyclamav, c-icap-modules.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.101.4+dfsg-0+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
