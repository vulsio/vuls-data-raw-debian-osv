	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities have been addressed in the systemd components\nsystemd-tmpfiles and pam\\_systemd.so.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-18078](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18078)\nsystemd-tmpfiles in systemd attempted to support ownership/permission\n changes on hardlinked files even if the fs.protected\\_hardlinks sysctl\n is turned off, which allowed local users to bypass intended access\n restrictions via vectors involving a hard link to a file for which\n the user lacked write access.\n* [CVE-2019-3842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3842)\nIt was discovered that pam\\_systemd did not properly sanitize the\n environment before using the XDG\\_SEAT variable. It was possible for\n an attacker, in some particular configurations, to set a XDG\\_SEAT\n environment variable which allowed for commands to be checked against\n polkit policies using the allow\\_active element rather than\n allow\\_any.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n215-17+deb8u12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
