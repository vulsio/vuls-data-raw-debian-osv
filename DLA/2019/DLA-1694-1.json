	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were found in QEMU, a fast processor emulator:\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-12617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12617)\nThe qmp\\_guest\\_file\\_read function (qga/commands-posix.c) is affected\n by an integer overflow and subsequent memory allocation failure. This\n weakness might be leveraged by remote attackers to cause denial of\n service (application crash).\n* [CVE-2018-16872](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16872)\nThe usb\\_mtp\\_get\\_object, usb\\_mtp\\_get\\_partial\\_object and\n usb\\_mtp\\_object\\_readdir functions (hw/usb/dev-mtp.c) are affected by a\n symlink attack. Remote attackers might leverage this vulnerability to\n perform information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2019-6778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6778)\nThe tcp\\_emu function (slirp/tcp\\_subr.c) is affected by a heap buffer\n overflow caused by insufficient validation of available space in the\n sc\\_rcv->sb\\_data buffer. Remote attackers might leverage this flaw to\n cause denial of service, or any other unspecified impact.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u10.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
