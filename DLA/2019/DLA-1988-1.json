	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Ampache, a web-based audio\nfile management system.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-12385](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12385)\nA stored XSS exists in the localplay.php LocalPlay add instance\n functionality. The injected code is reflected in the instances menu.\n This vulnerability can be abused to force an admin to create a new\n privileged user whose credentials are known by the attacker.\n* [CVE-2019-12386](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12386)\nThe search engine is affected by a SQL Injection, so any user able\n to perform lib/class/search.class.php searches (even guest users)\n can dump any data contained in the database (sessions, hashed\n passwords, etc.). This may lead to a full compromise of admin\n accounts, when combined with the weak password generator algorithm\n used in the lostpassword functionality.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.6-rzb2752+dfsg-5+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ampache packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
