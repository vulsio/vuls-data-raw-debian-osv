	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there was an integer overflow vulnerability in librabbitmq, a library for robust messaging between applications and servers.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-18609](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18609)\nAn issue was discovered in amqp\\_handle\\_input in amqp\\_connection.c in rabbitmq-c 0.9.0. There is an integer overflow that leads to heap memory corruption in the handling of CONNECTION\\_STATE\\_HEADER. A rogue server could return a malicious frame header that leads to a smaller target\\_size value than needed. This condition is then carried on to a memcpy function that copies too much data into a heap buffer.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.5.2-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your librabbitmq packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
