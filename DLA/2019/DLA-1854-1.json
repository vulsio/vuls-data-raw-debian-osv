	"details": "\nA use-after-free in onig\\_new\\_deluxe() in regext.c allows attackers to\npotentially cause information disclosure, denial of service, or\npossibly code execution by providing a crafted regular expression. The\nattacker\nprovides a pair of a regex pattern and a string, with a multi-byte\nencoding that gets handled by onig\\_new\\_deluxe().\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n5.9.5-3.2+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libonig packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
