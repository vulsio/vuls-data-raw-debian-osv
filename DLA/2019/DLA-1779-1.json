	"summary": "389-ds-base - security update",
	"details": "\nIn 389-ds-base up to version 1.4.1.2, requests were handled by worker\nthreads. Each socket had been waited for by the worker for at most\nioblocktimeout seconds. However, this timeout applied only to\nun-encrypted requests. Connections using SSL/TLS were not taking this\ntimeout into account during reads, and may have hung longer. An\nunauthenticated attacker could have repeatedly created hanging LDAP\nrequests to hang all the workers, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.3.3.5-4+deb8u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your 389-ds-base packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
