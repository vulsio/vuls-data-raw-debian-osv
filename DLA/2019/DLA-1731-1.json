	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-10741](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10741)\nA race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a\n crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume\n could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-5753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5753)\nFurther instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1\n (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.\n* [CVE-2017-13305](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13305)\nA memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's\n encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of\n service or possibly to read sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2018-3639](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-3639) (SSB)\n\n Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass\n (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to\n read sensitive information from another context. In particular,\n code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive\n information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as\n Spectre variant 4.\n\n\nThis update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD\n processors.\n* [CVE-2018-5848](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5848)\nThe wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan\n and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.\n On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN\n capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption\n or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-5953](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5953)\nThe swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the\n system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other\n vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2018-12896](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12896), [CVE-2018-13053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-13053)\nTeam OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX\n timer implementation. These might have some security impact.\n* [CVE-2018-16862](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16862)\nVasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team\n discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not\n invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the\n tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other\n users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the\n same volume.\n* [CVE-2018-16884](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16884)\nA flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting\n NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could\n lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this\n for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly\n for privilege escalation.\n\n\nThis can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from\n creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.\n* [CVE-2018-17972](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17972)\nJann Horn reported that the /proc/\\*/stack files in procfs leaked\n sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable\n by users with the CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN capability (usually only root)\n* [CVE-2018-18281](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-18281)\nJann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager\n that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after\n it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create\n containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service\n (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-18690](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-18690)\nKanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some\n xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk\n format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use\n this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-18710](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-18710)\nIt was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly\n validate the parameter to the CDROM\\_SELECT\\_DISC ioctl. A user with\n access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive\n information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service\n (crash).\n* [CVE-2018-19824](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-19824)\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the\n USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a\n specially designed USB device could use this for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-19985](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-19985)\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the\n hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a\n specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive\n information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service\n (crash).\n* [CVE-2018-20169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20169)\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the\n USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially\n designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service\n (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-20511](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20511)\nInfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP\n implemntation. A local user with CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability could\n use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.\n* [CVE-2019-3701](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3701)\nMuyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway\n implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically\n resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes. On a system\n with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN\n capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a\n crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.\n* [CVE-2019-3819](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3819)\nA potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs\n interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access\n to these files could use this for denial of service.\n\n\nThis interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully\n mitigates the issue.\n* [CVE-2019-6974](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6974)\nJann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user\n with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of\n service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-7221](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-7221)\nJim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in\n KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a\n local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a\n denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n\n\nNested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the\n issue.\n* [CVE-2019-7222](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-7222)\nFelix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.\n A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read\n sensitive information from the kernel.\n* [CVE-2019-9213](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9213)\nJann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack\n segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to\n address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this\n exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference\n could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for\n denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.16.64-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
