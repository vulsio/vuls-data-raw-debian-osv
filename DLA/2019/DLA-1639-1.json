A local attacker, or a remote one if\n systemd-journal-remote is used, may use this flaw to crash\n systemd-journald or execute code with journald privileges.\n* [CVE-2018-16865](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16865)\nAn allocation of memory without limits, that could result in the\n stack clashing with another memory region, was discovered in\n systemd-journald when a program with long command line arguments\n calls syslog. A local attacker may use this flaw to crash\n systemd-journald or escalate his privileges. Versions through v240\n are vulnerable.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n215-17+deb8u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
