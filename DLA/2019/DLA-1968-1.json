This vulnerability might be leveraged\n by remote attackers to cause denial of service via a crafted Cineon image.\n* [CVE-2019-14981](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14981)\nDivide-by-zero vulnerability in MeanShiftImage (magick/feature.c). This\n vulnerability might be leveraged by remote attackers to cause denial of\n service via crafted image data.\n* [CVE-2019-15139](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15139)\nOut-of-bounds read in ReadXWDImage (coders/xwd.c). This vulnerability might\n be leveraged by remote attackers to cause denial of service via a crafted\n XWD (X Window System window dumping file) image file.\n* [CVE-2019-15140](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15140)\nBound checking issue in ReadMATImage (coders/mat.c), potentially leading to\n use-after-free. This vulnerability might be leveraged by remote attackers to\n cause denial of service or any other unspecified impact via a crafted MAT\n image file.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u18.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
