	"details": "\nSquid, a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, has been\nfound vulnerable to denial of service attacks associated with HTTP\nauthentication header processing.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-12525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12525)\nDue to incorrect buffer management Squid is vulnerable to a denial\n of service attack when processing HTTP Digest Authentication\n credentials.\n\n\nDue to incorrect input validation the HTTP Request header parser for\n Digest authentication may access memory outside the allocated memory\n buffer.\n\n\nOn systems with memory access protections this can result in the\n Squid process being terminated unexpectedly. Resulting in a denial\n of service for all clients using the proxy.\n* [CVE-2019-12529](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12529)\nDue to incorrect buffer management Squid is vulnerable to a denial\n of service attack when processing HTTP Basic Authentication\n credentials.\n\n\nDue to incorrect string termination the Basic authentication\n credentials decoder may access memory outside the decode buffer.\n\n\nOn systems with memory access protections this can result in the\n Squid process being terminated unexpectedly. Resulting in a denial\n of service for all clients using the proxy.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.4.8-6+deb8u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
