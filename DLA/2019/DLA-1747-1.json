	"details": "\nEli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered a cryptographic weakness in the\nBluetooth LE SC pairing protocol, called the Fixed Coordinate Invalid\nCurve Attack ([CVE-2018-5383](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5383)). Depending on the devices used, this\ncould be exploited by a nearby attacker to obtain sensitive\ninformation, for denial of service, or for other security impact.\n\n\nThis flaw has been fixed in firmware for Intel Wireless 7260 (B3),\n7260 (B5), 7265 (D1), and 8264 adapters, and for Qualcomm Atheros\nQCA61x4 ROME version 3.2 adapters. Other Bluetooth adapters are\nalso affected and remain vulnerable.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n20161130-5~deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your firmware-nonfree packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
