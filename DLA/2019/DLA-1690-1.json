This issue\n might happen during error handling when processing two GET and\n POST requests being sent with identical x-sessioncookie within\n the same TCP session and might be leveraged by remote attackers\n to cause DoS.\n* [CVE-2019-7314](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-7314)\nliblivemedia servers with RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling enabled are\n affected by a use-after-free vulnerability. This vulnerability\n might be triggered by remote attackers to cause DoS (server crash)\n or possibly unspecified other impact.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2014.01.13-1+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your liblivemedia packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
