	"details": "\nSeveral issues in gdk-pixbuf, a library to handle pixbuf, have been found.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-6352](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6352)\nfix for denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) via\n crafted dimensions in an ICO file\n* [CVE-2017-2870](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2870)\nFix for an exploitable integer overflow vulnerability in the\n tiff\\_image\\_parse functionality. When software is compiled with\n clang, A specially crafted tiff file can cause a heap-overflow\n resulting in remote code execution. Debian package is compiled\n with gcc and is not affected, but probably some downstream is.\n* [CVE-2017-6312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6312)\nFix for an integer overflow in io-ico.c that allows attackers\n to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and application\n crash) via a crafted image\n* [CVE-2017-6313](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6313)\nFix for an integer underflow in the load\\_resources function in\n io-icns.c that allows attackers to cause a denial of service\n (out-of-bounds read and program crash) via a crafted image entry\n size in an ICO file\n* [CVE-2017-6314](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6314)\nFix for an infinite loop in the make\\_available\\_at\\_least function\n in io-tiff.c that allows attackers to cause a denial of service\n via a large TIFF file.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.31.1-2+deb8u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gdk-pixbuf packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
