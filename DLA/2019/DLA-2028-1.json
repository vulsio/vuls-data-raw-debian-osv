	"details": "\nIt was found that Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for\nweb clients, has been affected by the following security\nvulnerabilities.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-12526](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12526)\nURN response handling in Squid suffers from a heap-based buffer\n overflow. When receiving data from a remote server in response to\n an URN request, Squid fails to ensure that the response can fit\n within the buffer. This leads to attacker controlled data\n overflowing in the heap.\n* [CVE-2019-18677](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18677)\nWhen the append\\_domain setting is used (because the appended\n characters do not properly interact with hostname length\n restrictions), it can inappropriately redirect traffic to origins\n it should not be delivered to. This happens because of incorrect\n message processing.\n* [CVE-2019-18678](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18678)\nA programming error allows attackers to smuggle HTTP requests\n through frontend software to a Squid instance that splits the HTTP\n Request pipeline differently. The resulting Response messages\n corrupt caches (between a client and Squid) with\n attacker-controlled content at arbitrary URLs. Effects are isolated\n to software between the attacker client and Squid.\n There are no effects on Squid itself, nor on any upstream servers.\n The issue is related to a request header containing whitespace\n between a header name and a colon.\n* [CVE-2019-18679](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18679)\nDue to incorrect data management, Squid is vulnerable to\n information disclosure when processing HTTP Digest Authentication.\n Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer that sits\n within heap memory allocation. This information reduces ASLR\n protections and may aid attackers isolating memory areas to target\n for remote code execution attacks.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.4.8-6+deb8u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
