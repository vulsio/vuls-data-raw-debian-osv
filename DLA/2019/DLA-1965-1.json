	"details": "\nIn the nfs-utils package, providing support files for Network File\nSystem (NFS) including the rpc.statd daemon, the directory\n/var/lib/nfs is owned by statd:nogroup. This directory contains files\nowned and managed by root. If statd is compromised, it can therefore\ntrick processes running with root privileges into creating/overwriting\nfiles anywhere on the system.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.2.8-9+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nfs-utils packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
