Ansible did not verify that the\n server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name\n (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows\n man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary\n valid certificate.\n* [CVE-2015-6240](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6240)\nA symlink attack that allows local users to escape a restricted\n environment (chroot or jail) via a symlink attack.\n* [CVE-2018-10875](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10875)\nA fix potential arbitrary code execution resulting from reading\n ansible.cfg from a world-writable current working directory. This\n condition now causes ansible to emit a warning and ignore the\n ansible.cfg in the world-writable current working directory.\n* [CVE-2019-10156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10156)\nInformation disclosure through unexpected variable substitution.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.7.2+dfsg-2+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
