	],
	"summary": "uw-imap - security update",
	"details": "\nA vulnerability was discovered in uw-imap, the University of Washington\nIMAP Toolkit, that might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS\ncommands if the IMAP server name is untrusted input (e.g., entered by a\nuser of a web application) and if rsh has been replaced by a program\nwith different argument semantics.\n\n\nThis update disables access to IMAP mailboxes through running imapd over\nrsh, and therefore ssh for users of the client application. Code which\nuses the library can still enable it with tcp\\_parameters() after making\nsure that the IMAP server name is sanitized.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n8:2007f~dfsg-4+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your uw-imap packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
