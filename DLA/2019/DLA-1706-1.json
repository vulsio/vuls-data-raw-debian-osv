	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities were discovered in the poppler PDF\nrendering shared library.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-19058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-19058)\nA reachable abort in Object.h will lead to denial-of-service because\n EmbFile::save2 in FileSpec.cc lacks a stream check before saving an\n embedded file.\n* [CVE-2018-20481](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20481)\nPoppler mishandles unallocated XRef entries, which allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial-of-service (NULL pointer dereference)\n via a crafted PDF document.\n* [CVE-2018-20662](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20662)\nPoppler allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application\n crash and segmentation fault by crafting a PDF file in which an xref\n data structure is corrupted.\n* [CVE-2019-7310](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-7310)\nA heap-based buffer over-read (due to an integer signedness error in\n the XRef::getEntry function in XRef.cc) allows remote attackers to\n cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have\n unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document.\n* [CVE-2019-9200](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9200)\nA heap-based buffer underwrite exists in ImageStream::getLine()\n located at Stream.cc that can (for example) be triggered by sending\n a crafted PDF file to the pdfimages binary. It allows an attacker to\n cause denial-of-service (segmentation fault) or possibly have\n unspecified other impact.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.26.5-2+deb8u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
