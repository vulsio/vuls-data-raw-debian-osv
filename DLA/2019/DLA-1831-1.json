	"details": "\nMore Polymorphic Typing issues were discovered in jackson-databind. When\nDefault Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property)\nfor an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has JDOM 1.x or\n2.x or logback-core jar in the classpath, an attacker can send a\nspecifically crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary\nlocal files on the server.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.4.2-2+deb8u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
