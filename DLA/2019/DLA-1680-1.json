This\n vulnerability can be triggered by the executable tiffcp.\n* [CVE-2018-19210](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-19210)\nThere is a NULL pointer dereference in the TIFFWriteDirectorySec function\n in tif\\_dirwrite.c that will lead to a denial of service attack, as\n demonstrated by tiffset.\n* [CVE-2019-7663](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-7663)\nAn Invalid Address dereference was discovered in\n TIFFWriteDirectoryTagTransferfunction in libtiff/tif\\_dirwrite.c,\n affecting the cpSeparateBufToContigBuf function in tiffcp.c. Remote\n attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service\n via a crafted tiff file.\n\n\nWe believe this is the same as [CVE-2018-17000](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17000) (above).\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.0.3-12.3+deb8u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
