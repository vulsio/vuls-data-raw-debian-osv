	"details": "\nA vulnerability was found in sssd. If a user was configured with no home\ndirectory set, sssd would return '/' (the root directory) instead of ''\n(the empty string / no home directory). This could impact services that\nrestrict the user's filesystem access to within their home directory\nthrough chroot() etc.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.11.7-3+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sssd packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
