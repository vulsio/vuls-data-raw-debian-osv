	"summary": "icedtea-web - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities were found in icedtea-web, an\nimplementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP).\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-10181](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10181)\nIt was found that in icedtea-web executable code could be injected\n in a JAR file without compromising the signature verification. An\n attacker could use this flaw to inject code in a trusted JAR. The\n code would be executed inside the sandbox.\n* [CVE-2019-10182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10182)\nIt was found that icedtea-web did not properly sanitize paths from\n <jar/> elements in JNLP files. An attacker could trick a victim\n into running a specially crafted application and use this flaw to\n upload arbitrary files to arbitrary locations in the context of the\n user.\n* [CVE-2019-10185](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10185)\nIt was found that icedtea-web was vulnerable to a zip-slip attack\n during auto-extraction of a JAR file. An attacker could use this\n flaw to write files to arbitrary locations. This could also be used\n to replace the main running application and, possibly, break out of\n the sandbox.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.5.3-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your icedtea-web packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
