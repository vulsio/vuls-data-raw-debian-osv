	"summary": "graphite-web - security update",
	"details": "\nThe send\\_email function in graphite-web/webapp/graphite/composer/views.py\nin Graphite is vulnerable to SSRF. The vulnerable SSRF endpoint can be used\nby an attacker to have the Graphite web server request any resource.\nThe response to this SSRF request is encoded into an image file and then sent\nto an e-mail address that can be supplied by the attacker. Thus, an attacker\ncan exfiltrate any information.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.9.12+debian-6+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your graphite-web packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
