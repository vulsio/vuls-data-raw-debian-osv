	"details": "\nA flaw was found in the amd64 implementation of salsa20. If more\nthan 256 GiB of keystream is generated, or if the counter otherwise\ngrows greater than 32 bits, the amd64 implementation will first generate\nincorrect output, and then cycle back to previously generated keystream.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.0~hg190-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nobfs4proxy has been rebuilt as version 0.0.3-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your golang-golang-x-crypto-dev\nand obfs4proxy packages, and rebuild any software using\ngolang-golang-x-crypto-dev.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
