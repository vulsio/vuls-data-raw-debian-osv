This is caused by\n mishandling of serialized data at phar:// URLs in the\n wp\\_get\\_attachment\\_thumb\\_file function in wp-includes/post.php.\n* [CVE-2018-20149](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20149)\nWhen the Apache HTTP Server is used, authors could upload crafted\n files that bypass intended MIME type restrictions, leading to XSS,\n as demonstrated by a .jpg file without JPEG data.\n* [CVE-2018-20150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20150)\nCrafted URLs could trigger XSS for certain use cases involving\n plugins.\n* [CVE-2018-20151](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20151)\nThe user-activation page could be read by a search engine's web\n crawler if an unusual configuration were chosen. The search engine\n could then index and display a user's e-mail address and (rarely)\n the password that was generated by default.\n* [CVE-2018-20152](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20152)\nAuthors could bypass intended restrictions on post types via crafted\n input.\n* [CVE-2018-20153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20153)\nContributors could modify new comments made by users with greater\n privileges, possibly causing XSS.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.1.25+dfsg-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
