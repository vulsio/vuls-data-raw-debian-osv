This could\n allow an attacker to discern whether a byte on the stack contains\n the characters A, a, I, i, or 0, or any other character.\n* [CVE-2019-13118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13118)\nA type holding grouping characters of an xsl:number instruction was\n too narrow and an invalid character/length combination could be\n passed to xsltNumberFormatDecimal, leading to a read of\n uninitialized stack data.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.1.28-2+deb8u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
