Malformed\nsignatures could lead to unexpected exceptions and in some cases did\nnot raise any exception.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.11-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-ecdsa packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
