	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been resolved in libjpeg-turbo, Debian's\ndefault JPEG implemenation.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-3616](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3616)\nThe cjpeg utility in libjpeg allowed remote attackers to cause a\n denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or\n execute arbitrary code via a crafted file.\n\n\nThis issue got fixed by the same patch that fixed [CVE-2018-11213](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11213) and\n [CVE-2018-11214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11214).\n* [CVE-2018-1152](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1152)\nlibjpeg-turbo has been found vulnerable to a denial of service\n vulnerability caused by a divide by zero when processing a crafted\n BMP image. The issue has been resolved by a boundary check.\n* [CVE-2018-11212](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11212)\nThe alloc\\_sarray function in jmemmgr.c allowed remote attackers to\n cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error) via a crafted file.\n\n\nThe issue has been addressed by checking the image size when reading\n a targa file and throwing an error when image width or height is 0.\n* [CVE-2018-11213](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11213) /\n [CVE-2018-11214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11214)\nThe get\\_text\\_gray\\_row and get\\_text\\_rgb\\_row functions in rdppm.c both\n allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (Segmentation\n fault) via a crafted file.\n\n\nBy checking the range of integer values in PPM text files and adding\n checks to ensure values are within the specified range, both issues\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:1.3.1-12+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libjpeg-turbo packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
