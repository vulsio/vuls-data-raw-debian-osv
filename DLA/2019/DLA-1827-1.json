	"summary": "gvfs - security update",
	"details": "\nSimon McVittie discovered a flaw in gvfs, the Gnome Virtual File\nSystem. The gvfsd daemon opened a private D-Bus server socket without\nconfiguring an authorization rule. A local attacker could connect to\nthis server socket and issue D-Bus method calls.\n\n\n(Note that the server socket only accepts a single connection, so the\nattacker would have to discover the server and connect to the socket\nbefore its owner does.)\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.22.2-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gvfs packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
