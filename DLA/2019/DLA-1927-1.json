	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were found in QEMU, a fast processor emulator\n(notably used in KVM and Xen HVM virtualization).\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-5126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5126)\nHeap-based buffer overflow in the iscsi\\_aio\\_ioctl function in\n block/iscsi.c in QEMU allows local guest OS users to cause a\n denial of service (QEMU process crash) or possibly execute\n arbitrary code via a crafted iSCSI asynchronous I/O ioctl call.\n* [CVE-2016-5403](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5403)\nThe virtqueue\\_pop function in hw/virtio/virtio.c in QEMU allows\n local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (memory\n consumption and QEMU process crash) by submitting requests without\n waiting for completion.\n* [CVE-2017-9375](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9375)\nQEMU, when built with USB xHCI controller emulator support, allows\n local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service\n (infinite recursive call) via vectors involving control transfer\n descriptors sequencing.\n* [CVE-2019-12068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12068)\nQEMU scsi disk backend: lsi: exit infinite loop while executing\n script\n* [CVE-2019-12155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12155)\ninterface\\_release\\_resource in hw/display/qxl.c in QEMU has a NULL\n pointer dereference.\n* [CVE-2019-13164](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13164)\nqemu-bridge-helper.c in QEMU does not ensure that a network\n interface name (obtained from bridge.conf or a --br=bridge option)\n is limited to the IFNAMSIZ size, which can lead to an ACL bypass.\n* [CVE-2019-14378](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14378)\nip\\_reass in ip\\_input.c in libslirp 4.0.0 has a heap-based buffer\n overflow via a large packet because it mishandles a case involving\n the first fragment.\n* [CVE-2019-15890](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15890)\nlibslirp 4.0.0, as used in QEMU, has a use-after-free in ip\\_reass\n in ip\\_input.c.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
