	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in rubygems embedded in\nruby2.1, the interpreted scripting language.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-8320](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8320)\nA Directory Traversal issue was discovered in RubyGems. Before\n making new directories or touching files (which now include\n path-checking code for symlinks), it would delete the target\n destination.\n* [CVE-2019-8322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8322)\nThe gem owner command outputs the contents of the API response\n directly to stdout. Therefore, if the response is crafted, escape\n sequence injection may occur.\n* [CVE-2019-8323](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8323)\nGem::GemcutterUtilities#with\\_response may output the API response to\n stdout as it is. Therefore, if the API side modifies the response,\n escape sequence injection may occur.\n* [CVE-2019-8324](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8324)\nA crafted gem with a multi-line name is not handled correctly.\n Therefore, an attacker could inject arbitrary code to the stub line\n of gemspec, which is eval-ed by code in ensure\\_loadable\\_spec during\n the preinstall check.\n* [CVE-2019-8325](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8325)\nAn issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2.\n Since Gem::CommandManager#run calls alert\\_error without escaping,\n escape sequence injection is possible. (There are many ways to cause\n an error.)\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.1.5-2+deb8u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.1 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
