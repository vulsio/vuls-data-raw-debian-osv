	"details": "\nIt was found that the fallback mechanism for generating a WPS pin in\nhostapd, an IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator,\nused a low quality pseudorandom number generator. This was resolved by\nusing only the high quality os\\_get\\_random function.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.3-1+deb8u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
