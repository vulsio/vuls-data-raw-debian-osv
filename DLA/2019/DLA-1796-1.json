This attack appear to be\n exploitable via victim must run the `gem owner` command on a gem\n with a specially crafted YAML file\n* [CVE-2018-1000075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000075)\nan infinite loop caused by negative size vulnerability in ruby gem\n package tar header that can result in a negative size could cause an\n infinite loop\n* [CVE-2018-1000076](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000076)\nImproper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability in\n package.rb that can result in a mis-signed gem could be installed,\n as the tarball would contain multiple gem signatures.\n* [CVE-2018-1000077](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000077)\nImproper Input Validation vulnerability in ruby gems specification\n homepage attribute that can result in a malicious gem could set an\n invalid homepage URL\n* [CVE-2018-1000078](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000078)\nCross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in gem server display of\n homepage attribute that can result in XSS. This attack appear to be\n exploitable via the victim must browse to a malicious gem on a\n vulnerable gem server\n* [CVE-2019-8321](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8321)\nGem::UserInteraction#verbose calls say without escaping, escape\n sequence injection is possible\n* [CVE-2019-8322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8322)\nThe gem owner command outputs the contents of the API response\n directly to stdout. Therefore, if the response is crafted, escape\n sequence injection may occur\n* [CVE-2019-8323](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8323)\nGem::GemcutterUtilities#with\\_response may output the API response to\n stdout as it is. Therefore, if the API side modifies the response,\n escape sequence injection may occur.\n* [CVE-2019-8324](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8324)\nA crafted gem with a multi-line name is not handled correctly.\n Therefore, an attacker could inject arbitrary code to the stub line\n of gemspec\n* [CVE-2019-8325](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-8325)\nGem::CommandManager#run calls alert\\_error without escaping, escape\n sequence injection is possible. (There are many ways to cause an\n error.)\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.5.6-9+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jruby packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
