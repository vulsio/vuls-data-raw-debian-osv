	"details": "\nIt was discovered that the Django Python web development framework did not correct identify HTTP connections when a reverse proxy connected via HTTPS.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-12781: Incorrect HTTP detection with reverse-proxy connecting via HTTPS](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12781)\nWhen deployed behind a reverse-proxy connecting to Django via HTTPS, django.http.HttpRequest.scheme would incorrectly detect client requests made via HTTP as using HTTPS. This entails incorrect results for is\\_secure(), and build\\_absolute\\_uri(), and that HTTP requests would not be redirected to HTTPS in accordance with SECURE\\_SSL\\_REDIRECT.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.7.11-1+deb8u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
