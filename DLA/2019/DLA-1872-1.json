	"details": "\nIt was discovered that there were two vulnerabilities in the Django web development framework:\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-14232](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14232)\nPrevent a possible denial-of-service in django.utils.text.Truncator.\n\n\nIf django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed\n the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs\n due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression.\n The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the\n truncatechars\\_html and truncatewords\\_html template filters, which were thus\n vulnerable.\n\n\nThe regular expressions used by Truncator have been simplified in order\n to avoid potential backtracking issues. As a consequence, trailing\n punctuation may now at times be included in the truncated output.\n* [CVE-2019-14233](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14233)\nPrevent a possible denial-of-service in strip\\_tags().\n\n\nDue to the behavior of the underlying HTMLParser,\n django.utils.html.strip\\_tags() would be extremely slow to evaluate certain\n inputs containing large sequences of nested incomplete HTML entities. The\n strip\\_tags() method is used to implement the corresponding striptags\n template filter, which was thus also vulnerable.\n\n\nstrip\\_tags() now avoids recursive calls to HTMLParser when progress\n removing tags, but necessarily incomplete HTML entities, stops being\n made.\n\n\nRemember that absolutely NO guarantee is provided about the results of\n strip\\_tags() being HTML safe. So NEVER mark safe the result of a\n strip\\_tags() call without escaping it first, for example with\n django.utils.html.escape().\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.7.11-1+deb8u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
