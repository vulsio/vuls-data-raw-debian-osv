	"details": "\nTwo buffer allocation issues were identified in poppler.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-9959](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9959)\nAn unexpected negative length value can cause an integer\n overflow, which in turn making it possible to allocate a large\n memory chunk on the heap with size controlled by an attacker.\n* [CVE-2019-10871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10871)\nThe RGB data are considered CMYK data and hence it reads 4 bytes\n instead of 3 bytes at the end of the image. The fixed version\n defines SPLASH\\_CMYK which is the upstream recommended solution.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.26.5-2+deb8u12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
