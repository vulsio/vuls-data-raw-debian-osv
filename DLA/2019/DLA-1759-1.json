	"details": "\nOut-of-bounds read and write conditions have been fixed in clamav.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-1787](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1787)\nAn out-of-bounds heap read condition may occur when scanning PDF\n documents. The defect is a failure to correctly keep track of the number\n of bytes remaining in a buffer when indexing file data.\n* [CVE-2019-1788](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1788)\nAn out-of-bounds heap write condition may occur when scanning OLE2 files\n such as Microsoft Office 97-2003 documents. The invalid write happens when\n an invalid pointer is mistakenly used to initialize a 32bit integer to\n zero. This is likely to crash the application.\n* [CVE-2019-1789](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1789)\nAn out-of-bounds heap read condition may occur when scanning PE files\n (i.e. Windows EXE and DLL files) that have been packed using Aspack as a\n result of inadequate bound-checking.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.100.3+dfsg-0+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
