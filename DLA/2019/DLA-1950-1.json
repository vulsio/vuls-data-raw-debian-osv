	"details": "\nA heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in openjpeg2, the\nopen-source JPEG 2000 codec. This vulnerability is caused by insufficient\nvalidation of width and height of image components in color\\_apply\\_icc\\_profile\n(src/bin/common/color.c).\n\n\nRemote attackers might leverage this vulnerability\nvia a crafted JP2 file, leading to denial of service (application crash) or any\nother undefined behavior.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.1.0-2+deb8u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openjpeg2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
