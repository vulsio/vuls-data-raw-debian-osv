	"summary": "symfony - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in symfony, a PHP\nweb application framework. Numerous symfony components are affected:\nFramework Bundle, Dependency Injection, Security, HttpFoundation\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-10909](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10909)\nValidation messages were not escaped when using the form theme of\n the PHP templating engine which, when validation messages may contain\n user input, could result in an XSS.\n\n\nFor further information, see the upstream advisory at\n <https://symfony.com/blog/cve-2019-10909-escape-validation-messages-in-the-php-templating-engine>\n* [CVE-2019-10910](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10910)\nService IDs derived from unfiltered user input could result in the\n execution of any arbitrary code, resulting in possible remote code\n execution.\n\n\nFor further information, see the upstream advisory at\n <https://symfony.com/blog/cve-2019-10910-check-service-ids-are-valid>\n* [CVE-2019-10911](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10911)\nThis fixes situations where part of an expiry time in a cookie could\n be considered part of the username, or part of the username could be\n considered part of the expiry time. An attacker could modify the\n remember me cookie and authenticate as a different user. This attack\n is only possible if remember me functionality is enabled and the two\n users share a password hash or the password hashes (e.g.\n UserInterface::getPassword()) are null for all users (which is valid\n if passwords are checked by an external system, e.g. an SSO).\n\n\nFor further information, see the upstream advisory at\n <https://symfony.com/blog/cve-2019-10911-add-a-separator-in-the-remember-me-cookie-hash>\n* [CVE-2019-10913](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10913)\nHTTP methods, from either the HTTP method itself or using the\n X-Http-Method-Override header were previously returned as the method\n in question without validation being done on the string, meaning\n that they could be used in dangerous contexts when left unescaped.\n\n\nFor further information, see the upstream advisory at\n <https://symfony.com/blog/cve-2019-10913-reject-invalid-http-method-overrides>\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.3.21+dfsg-4+deb8u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your symfony packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
