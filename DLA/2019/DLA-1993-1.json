	"summary": "mesa - security update",
	"details": "\nTim Brown discovered a shared memory permissions vulnerability in the\nMesa 3D graphics library. Some Mesa X11 drivers use shared-memory\nXImages to implement back buffers for improved performance, but Mesa\ncreates shared memory regions with permission mode 0777. An attacker\ncan access the shared memory without any specific permissions.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n10.3.2-1+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mesa packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
