	"details": "\nSeveral security issues have been corrected in multiple demuxers and\ndecoders of the libav multimedia library.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-9987](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9987)\nIn Libav, there was a heap-based buffer overflow in the function\n hpel\\_motion in mpegvideo\\_motion.c. A crafted input could have lead to\n a remote denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2018-5766](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5766)\nIn Libav there was an invalid memcpy in the av\\_packet\\_ref function of\n libavcodec/avpacket.c. Remote attackers could have leveraged this\n vulnerability to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a\n crafted avi file.\n* [CVE-2018-11102](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11102)\nA read access violation in the mov\\_probe function in\n libavformat/mov.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service (application crash), as demonstrated by avconv.\n* [CVE-2019-14372](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14372)\nIn Libav, there was an infinite loop in the function\n wv\\_read\\_block\\_header() in the file wvdec.c.\n* [CVE-2019-14442](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14442)\nIn mpc8\\_read\\_header in libavformat/mpc8.c, an input file could have\n resulted in an avio\\_seek infinite loop and hang, with 100% CPU\n consumption. Attackers could have leveraged this vulnerability to\n cause a denial of service via a crafted file.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n6:11.12-1~deb8u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libav packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
