	"summary": "kdepim - security update",
	"details": "\nA reply-based decryption oracle was found in kdepim, which provides\nthe KMail e-mail client.\n\n\nAn attacker in possession of S/MIME or PGP encrypted emails can wrap\nthem as sub-parts within a crafted multipart email. The encrypted\npart(s) can further be hidden using HTML/CSS or ASCII newline\ncharacters. This modified multipart email can be re-sent by the\nattacker to the intended receiver. If the receiver replies to this\n(benign looking) email, they unknowingly leak the plaintext of the\nencrypted message part(s) back to the attacker.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n4:4.14.1-1+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kdepim packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
