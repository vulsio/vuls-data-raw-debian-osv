	"summary": "phpmyadmin - security update",
	"details": "\nAn information leak issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. An attacker\ncan read any file on the server that the web server's user can\naccess. This is related to the mysql.allow\\_local\\_infile PHP\nconfiguration. When the AllowArbitraryServer configuration setting is\nset to false (default), the attacker needs a local MySQL account. When\nset to true, the attacker can exploit this with the use of a rogue\nMySQL server.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n4:4.2.12-2+deb8u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
