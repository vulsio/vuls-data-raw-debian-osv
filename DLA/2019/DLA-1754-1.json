	"details": "\nVarious vulnerabilities were discovered in Samba, SMB/CIFS file, print,\nand login server/client for Unix\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-9461](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9461)\nsmbd in Samba had a denial of service vulnerability (fd\\_open\\_atomic\n infinite loop with high CPU usage and memory consumption) due to\n wrongly handling dangling symlinks.\n* [CVE-2018-1050](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1050)\nSamba was vulnerable to a denial of service attack when the RPC\n spoolss service was configured to be run as an external daemon.\n Missing input sanitization checks on some of the input parameters to\n spoolss RPC calls could have caused the print spooler service to\n crash.\n* [CVE-2018-1057](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1057)\nOn a Samba 4 AD DC the LDAP server of Samba incorrectly validated\n permissions to modify passwords over LDAP allowing authenticated\n users to change any other users' passwords, including administrative\n users and privileged service accounts (eg Domain Controllers).\n\n\nThanks to the Ubuntu security team for having backported the rather\n invasive changeset to Samba in Ubuntu 14.04 (which we could use to\n patch Samba in Debian jessie LTS).\n* [CVE-2019-3880](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3880)\nA flaw was found in the way Samba implemented an RPC endpoint\n emulating the Windows registry service API. An unprivileged attacker\n could have used this flaw to create a new registry hive file anywhere\n they had unix permissions which could have lead to creation of a new\n file in the Samba share.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
