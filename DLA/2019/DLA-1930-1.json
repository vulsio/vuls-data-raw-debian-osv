	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-10905](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10905)\nA race condition was discovered in the GFS2 file-system\n implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free. On a system\n using GFS2, a local attacker could use this for denial of service\n (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-20976](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20976)\nIt was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not\n correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead\n to a use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2018-21008](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-21008)\nIt was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly\n handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after-free.\n The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2019-0136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0136)\nIt was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)\n did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)\n messages. A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service\n (loss of wifi connectivity).\n* [CVE-2019-9506](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9506)\nDaniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen\n discovered a weakness in the Bluetooth pairing protocols, dubbed\n the KNOB attack. An attacker that is nearby during pairing\n could use this to weaken the encryption used between the paired\n devices, and then to eavesdrop on and/or spoof communication\n between them.\n\n\nThis update mitigates the attack by requiring a minimum encryption\n key length of 56 bits.\n* [CVE-2019-14814](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14814), [CVE-2019-14815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14815), [CVE-2019-14816](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14816)\nMultiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which\n could lead to heap buffer overflows. A local user permitted to\n configure a device handled by this driver could probably use this\n for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-14821](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14821)\nMatt Delco reported a race condition in KVM's coalesced MMIO\n facility, which could lead to out-of-bounds access in the kernel.\n A local attacker permitted to access /dev/kvm could use this to\n cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly\n for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-14835](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14835)\nPeter Pi of Tencent Blade Team discovered a missing bounds check\n in vhost\\_net, the network back-end driver for KVM hosts, leading\n to a buffer overflow when the host begins live migration of a VM.\n An attacker in control of a VM could use this to cause a denial of\n service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege\n escalation on the host.\n* [CVE-2019-15117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15117)\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer reported a missing bounds check in the\n usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a buffer\n over-read. An attacker able to add USB devices could possibly use\n this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2019-15118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15118)\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer reported unbounded recursion in the\n usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a stack\n overflow. An attacker able to add USB devices could use this to\n cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly\n for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-15211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15211)\nThe syzkaller tool found a bug in the radio-raremono driver that\n could lead to a use-after-free. An attacker able to add and\n remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service\n (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-15212](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15212)\nThe syzkaller tool found that the rio500 driver does not work\n correctly if more than one device is bound to it. An attacker\n able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial of\n service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-15215](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15215)\nThe syzkaller tool found a bug in the cpia2\\_usb driver that leads\n to a use-after-free. An attacker able to add and remove USB\n devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\n corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-15218](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15218)\nThe syzkaller tool found that the smsusb driver did not validate\n that USB devices have the expected endpoints, potentially leading\n to a null pointer dereference. An attacker able to add USB\n devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).\n* [CVE-2019-15219](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15219)\nThe syzkaller tool found that a device initialisation error in the\n sisusbvga driver could lead to a null pointer dereference. An\n attacker able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial\n of service (BUG/oops).\n* [CVE-2019-15220](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15220)\nThe syzkaller tool found a race condition in the p54usb driver\n which could lead to a use-after-free. An attacker able to add and\n remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service\n (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-15221](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15221)\nThe syzkaller tool found that the line6 driver did not validate\n USB devices' maximum packet sizes, which could lead to a heap\n buffer overrun. An attacker able to add USB devices could use\n this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-15292](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15292)\nThe Hulk Robot tool found missing error checks in the Appletalk\n protocol implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free.\n The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2019-15807](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15807)\nJian Luo reported that the Serial Attached SCSI library (libsas)\n did not correctly handle failure to discover devices beyond a SAS\n expander. This could lead to a resource leak and crash (BUG).\n The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2019-15917](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15917)\nThe syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting\n UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use after-free. A local user with access to a pty device or other\n suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service\n (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-15926](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15926)\nIt was found that the ath6kl wifi driver did not consistently\n validate traffic class numbers in received control packets,\n leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses. A nearby attacker on\n the same wifi network could use this to cause a denial of service\n (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.16.74-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
