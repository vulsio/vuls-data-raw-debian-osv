	"details": "\nSeveral security issues have been fixed in otrs2, a well known trouble\nticket system.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-11563](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11563)\nAn attacker who is logged into OTRS as a customer can use the ticket\n overview screen to disclose internal article information of their\n customer tickets.\n* [CVE-2019-12746](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12746)\nA user logged into OTRS as an agent might unknowingly disclose their\n session ID by sharing the link of an embedded ticket article with\n third parties. This identifier can be then potentially abused in\n order to impersonate the agent user.\n* [CVE-2019-13458](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13458)\nAn attacker who is logged into OTRS as an agent user with\n appropriate permissions can leverage OTRS tags in templates in order\n to disclose hashed user passwords.\n\n\nDue to an incomplete fix for [CVE-2019-12248](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12248), viewing email attachments\nwas no longer possible. This update correctly implements the new\nTicket::Fronted::BlockLoadingRemoteContent option.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.3.18-1+deb8u11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your otrs2 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
