This vulnerability might be leveraged by remote attackers\n using a crafted WAV file to cause denial of service (application crash).\n* [CVE-2017-15372](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15372)\nThe lsx\\_ms\\_adpcm\\_block\\_expand\\_i function (adpcm.c) is affected by a\n stack based buffer overflow. This vulnerability might be leveraged by\n remote attackers using a crafted audio file to cause denial of service\n (application crash).\n* [CVE-2017-15642](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15642)\nThe lsx\\_aiffstartread function (aiff.c) is affected by a use-after-free\n vulnerability. This flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using a\n crafted AIFF file to cause denial of service (application crash).\n* [CVE-2017-18189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18189)\nThe startread function (xa.c) is affected by a null pointer dereference\n vulnerability. This flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers using a\n crafted Maxis XA audio file to cause denial of service (application\n crash).\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n14.4.1-5+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
