	"details": "\nVarious minor issues have been addressed in the GLib library. GLib is a\nuseful general-purpose C library used by projects such as GTK+, GIMP,\nand GNOME.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-16428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16428)\nIn GNOME GLib, g\\_markup\\_parse\\_context\\_end\\_parse() in gmarkup.c\n had a NULL pointer dereference.\n* [CVE-2018-16429](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16429)\nGNOME GLib had an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in\n g\\_markup\\_parse\\_context\\_parse() in gmarkup.c, related to utf8\\_str().\n* [CVE-2019-13012](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13012)\nThe keyfile settings backend in GNOME GLib (aka glib2.0) before\n created directories using g\\_file\\_make\\_directory\\_with\\_parents\n (kfsb->dir, NULL, NULL) and files using g\\_file\\_replace\\_contents\n (kfsb->file, contents, length, NULL, FALSE,\n G\\_FILE\\_CREATE\\_REPLACE\\_DESTINATION, NULL, NULL, NULL). Consequently,\n it did not properly restrict directory (and file) permissions.\n Instead, for directories, 0777 permissions were used; for files,\n default file permissions were used. This issue is similar to\n [CVE-2019-12450](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12450).\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.42.1-1+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your glib2.0 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
