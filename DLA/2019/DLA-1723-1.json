Florian Weimer discovered that\n a missing check for the return value of calloc() could crash the\n daemon, which could be triggered by a very large crontab created by a\n user.\n* [CVE-2019-9705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9705)\nEnforce maximum crontab line count of 1000 to prevent a malicious\n user from creating an excessivly large crontab. The daemon will log a\n warning for existing files, and crontab(1) will refuse to create new\n ones.\n* [CVE-2019-9706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9706)\nA user reported a use-after-free condition in the cron daemon,\n leading to a possible Denial-of-Service scenario by crashing the\n daemon.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.0pl1-127+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cron packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
