	"details": "\nColin Snover discovered a denial-of-service vulnerability in phpBB3, a\nfull-featured web forum. Previous versions allowed users to run searches\nthat might result in long execution times and load on larger boards when\nusing the fulltext native search engine. To combat this, further\nrestrictions were introduced on search queries.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.0.12-5+deb8u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpbb3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
