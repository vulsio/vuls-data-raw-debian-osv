The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-11782](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11782)\nAce Olszowka reported that the Subversion's svnserve server process\n may exit when a well-formed read-only request produces a particular\n answer, leading to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2019-0203](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0203)\nTomas Bortoli reported that the Subversion's svnserve server process\n may exit when a client sends certain sequences of protocol commands.\n If the server is configured with anonymous access enabled this could\n lead to a remote unauthenticated denial of service.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.8.10-6+deb8u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
