	"details": "\nAn open redirect, that allows an attacker to write an arbitrary file with\nsupplied filename and content to the current directory, by redirecting a\nrequest from HTTP to a crafted URL pointing to a server in his or hers control,\nwas found and reported in [CVE-2019-10751](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10751).\nThis was patched upstream and so when `--download` without `--output` results\nin a redirect, now only the initial URL is considered, not the final one.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.8.0-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your httpie packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
