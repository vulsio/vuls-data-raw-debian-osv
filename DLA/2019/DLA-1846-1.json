	"summary": "unzip - security update",
	"details": "\nDavid Fifield discovered a way to construct non-recursive zip bombs\nthat achieve a high compression ratio by overlapping files inside the\nzip container. However the output size increases quadratically in the\ninput size, reaching a compression ratio of over 28 million\n(10 MB -> 281 TB) at the limits of the zip format which can cause a\ndenial-of-service. Mark Adler provided a patch to detect and reject\nsuch zip files for the unzip program.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n6.0-16+deb8u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
