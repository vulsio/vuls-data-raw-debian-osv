	"summary": "pdns - security update",
	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities have been discovered in pdns, an authoritative DNS\nserver which may result in denial of service via malformed zone records\nand excessive NOTIFY packets in a master/slave setup.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-10162](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10162)\nAn issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server allowing\n an authorized user to cause the server to exit by inserting a\n crafted record in a MASTER type zone under their control. The issue\n is due to the fact that the Authoritative Server will exit when it\n runs into a parsing error while looking up the NS/A/AAAA records it\n is about to use for an outgoing notify.\n* [CVE-2019-10163](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10163)\nAn issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server allowing\n a remote, authorized master server to cause a high CPU load or even\n prevent any further updates to any slave zone by sending a large\n number of NOTIFY messages. Note that only servers configured as\n slaves are affected by this issue.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.4.1-4+deb8u10.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of pdns please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pdns>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
