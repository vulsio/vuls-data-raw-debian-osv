	"details": "\ndebian-security-support, the Debian security support coverage checker,\nhas been updated in jessie.\n\n\nThis marks the end of life of the Enigmail package in jessie. After many\nmonths of work to try backporting the various changes and fixes required\nto ensure a secure Enigmail package compatible with the newest version\nof Thunderbird now shipped in jessie, it is the LTS team's opinion that\nthe changes are too intrusive to ensure the stability of the\ndistribution as a whole.\n\n\nWhile Enigmail is still available on addons.mozilla.org, we do not\nrecommend that package is used, as downloads and executes arbitrary\nbinaries from the internet without the user's knowledge. It also doesn't\nrespect's Debian commitment to free software, in that it is not\nbuildable from source.\n\n\nWe instead recommend you upgrade workstations needing Enigmail to Debian\nstretch where proper updates are available.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Lenny, these issues have been fixed in debian-security-support version 2019.02.01~deb8u1\n\n\n",
