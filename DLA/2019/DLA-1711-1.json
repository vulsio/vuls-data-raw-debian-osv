A local attacker may\nuse this flaw to make systemd-journald crash.\n\n\nNote that as the systemd-journald service is not restarted automatically\na restart of the service or more safely a reboot is advised.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n215-17+deb8u11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
