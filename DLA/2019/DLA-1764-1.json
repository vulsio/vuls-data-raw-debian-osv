It was possible to use\n symlinks and subrepositories to defeat Mercurial's path-checking logic and\n write files outside a repository.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.1.2-2+deb8u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mercurial packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
