When the backup is restored the\n file is then created with arbitrary permissions.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.11+dfsg-4.1+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cpio packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
