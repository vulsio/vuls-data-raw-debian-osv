The new behaviour of an empty ACL file is a default\n policy of access denied.\n (this is in compliance with all newer releases)\n* [CVE-2018-12551](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12551)\nMalformed authentication data in the password file could allow\n clients to circumvent authentication and get access to the broker.\n* [CVE-2019-11779](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11779)\nFix for processing a crafted SUBSCRIBE packet containing a topic\n that consists of approximately 65400 or more '/' characters.\n (setting TOPIC\\_HIERARCHY\\_LIMIT to 200)\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.3.4-2+deb8u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
