	"details": "\nNick Roessler and Rafi Rubin discovered that the IMAP and ManageSieve\nprotocol parsers in the Dovecot email server do not properly validate\ninput (both pre- and post-login). A remote attacker can take advantage\nof this flaw to trigger out of bounds heap memory writes, leading to\ninformation leaks or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1:2.2.13-12~deb8u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
