	"details": "\nThe RTSP connection parser in the base GStreamer packages version 0.10,\nwhich is a streaming media framework, was vulnerable against an\nheap-based buffer overflow by sending a longer than allowed session id in\na response and including a semicolon to change the maximum length. This\ncould result in a remote code execution.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n0.10.36-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gst-plugins-base0.10 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
