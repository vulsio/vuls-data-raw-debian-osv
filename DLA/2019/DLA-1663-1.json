This issue\n might cause memory exhaustion, but is only relevant if the pickle format is\n used for serializing tens or hundreds of gigabytes of data.\n* [CVE-2019-5010](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5010)\nNULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.4.2-1+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python3.4 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
