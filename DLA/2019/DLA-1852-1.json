	],
	"summary": "python3.4 - security update",
	"details": "\nThe urllib library in Python ships support for a second, not well known\nURL scheme for accessing local files (\"local\\_file://\"). This scheme can\nbe used to circumvent protections that try to block local file access\nand only block the well-known \"file://\" schema. This update addresses\nthe vulnerability by disallowing the \"local\\_file://\" URL scheme.\n\n\nThis update also fixes another regresssion introduced in the update\nissued as DLA-1835-1 that broke installation of libpython3.4-testsuite.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n3.4.2-1+deb8u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python3.4 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python3.4 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python3.4>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
