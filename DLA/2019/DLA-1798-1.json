	"details": "\nA Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in jackson-databind, a JSON\nlibrary for Java. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or\nfor a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the\nservice has the mysql-connector-java jar (8.0.14 or earlier) in the\nclasspath, and an attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable\nby the victim, an attacker can send a crafted JSON message that allows\nthem to read arbitrary local files on the server. This occurs because of\nmissing com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin validation.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.4.2-2+deb8u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
