	"details": "\nSeveral minor issues have been fixed in mupdf, a lightweight PDF viewer\ntailored for display of high quality anti-aliased graphics.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-5686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5686)\nIn MuPDF, there was an infinite loop vulnerability and application\n hang in the pdf\\_parse\\_array function (pdf/pdf-parse.c) because EOF\n not having been considered. Remote attackers could leverage this\n vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF file.\n* [CVE-2019-6130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6130)\nMuPDF had a SEGV in the function fz\\_load\\_page of the fitz/document.c\n file, as demonstrated by mutool. This was related to page-number\n mishandling in cbz/mucbz.c, cbz/muimg.c, and svg/svg-doc.c.\n* [CVE-2018-6192](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6192)\nIn MuPDF, the pdf\\_read\\_new\\_xref function in pdf/pdf-xref.c allowed\n remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation\n and application crash) via a crafted PDF file.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.5-1+deb8u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mupdf packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
