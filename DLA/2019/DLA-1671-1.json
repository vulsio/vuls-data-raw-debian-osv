	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in coTURN, a TURN and STUN server for\nVoIP.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-4056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4056)\nAn SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the coTURN administrator\n web portal. As the administration web interface is shared with the\n production, it is unfortunately not possible to easily filter outside\n access and this security update completely disables the web interface. Users\n should use the local, command line interface instead.\n* [CVE-2018-4058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4058)\nDefault configuration enables unsafe loopback forwarding. A remote attacker\n with access to the TURN interface can use this vulnerability to gain access\n to services that should be local only.\n* [CVE-2018-4059](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4059)\nDefault configuration uses an empty password for the local command line\n administration interface. An attacker with access to the local console\n (either a local attacker or a remote attacker taking advantage of\n [CVE-2018-4058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4058)) could escalade privileges to administrator of the coTURN\n server.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.2.1.2-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your coturn packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
