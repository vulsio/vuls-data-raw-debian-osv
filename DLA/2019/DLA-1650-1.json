	"details": "\nThe ESnet security team discovered a vulnerability in rssh, a restricted\nshell that allows users to perform only scp, sftp, cvs, svnserve\n(Subversion), rdist and/or rsync operations. Missing validation in the\nscp support could result in the bypass of this restriction, allowing the\nexecution of arbitrary shell commands.\n\n\nPlease note that with the update applied, the \"-3\" option of scp can no\nlonger be used.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n2.3.4-4+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
