	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-5995](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5995)\nADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual\n addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to\n exploit other vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2018-12126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12126), [CVE-2018-12127](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12127), [CVE-2018-12130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12130), [CVE-2019-11091](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11091)\nMultiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way\n that Intel processor designs implement speculative forwarding of\n data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures\n (buffers). This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an\n unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from\n the kernel and all other processes running on the system, or\n across guest/host boundaries to read host memory.\n\n\nSee <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html>\n for more details.\n\n\nTo fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to\n install updated CPU microcode. An updated intel-microcode package\n (only available in Debian non-free) was provided via DLA-1789-1.\n The updated CPU microcode may also be available as part of a\n system firmware (\"BIOS\") update.\n* [CVE-2019-2024](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-2024)\nA use-after-free bug was discovered in the em28xx video capture\n driver. Local users might be able to use this for denial of\n service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-3459](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3459), [CVE-2019-3460](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3460)\nShlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Karamba Security Ltd. research\n team discovered missing range checks in the Bluetooth L2CAP\n implementation. If Bluetooth is enabled, a nearby attacker\n could use these to read sensitive information from the kernel.\n* [CVE-2019-3882](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3882)\nIt was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number\n of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership\n of a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service\n (out-of-memory condition).\n* [CVE-2019-3901](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3901)\nJann Horn of Google reported a race condition that would allow a\n local user to read performance events from a task after it\n executes a setuid program. This could leak sensitive information\n processed by setuid programs. Debian's kernel configuration does\n not allow unprivileged users to access peformance events by\n default, which fully mitigates this issue.\n* [CVE-2019-6133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6133)\nJann Horn of Google found that Policykit's authentication check\n could be bypassed by a local user creating a process with the same\n start time and process ID as an older authenticated process.\n PolicyKit was already updated to fix this in DLA-1644-1. The\n kernel has additionally been updated to avoid a delay between\n assigning start time and process ID, which should make the attack\n impractical.\n* [CVE-2019-9503](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9503)\nHugues Anguelkov and others at Quarkslab discovered that the\n brcmfmac (Broadcom wifi FullMAC) driver did not correctly\n distinguish messages sent by the wifi firmware from other packets.\n An attacker using the same wifi network could use this for denial\n of service or to exploit other vulnerabilities in the driver.\n* [CVE-2019-11190](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11190)\nRobert ĹwiÄcki reported that when a setuid program was executed it\n was still possible to read performance events while the kernel set\n up the program's address space. A local user could use this to\n defeat ASLR in a setuid program, making it easier to exploit other\n vulnerabilities in the program. Debian's kernel configuration\n does not allow unprivileged users to access peformance events by\n default, which fully mitigates this issue.\n* [CVE-2019-11486](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11486)\nJann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the\n Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to\n cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been\n disabled.\n* [CVE-2019-11599](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11599)\nJann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump\n implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local\n user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a\n denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege\n escalation.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.16.68-1. This version also includes a fix for Debian bug #927781,\nand other fixes included in upstream stable updates.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
