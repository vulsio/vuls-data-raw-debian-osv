	"summary": "jackson-databind - security update",
	"details": "\nMore deserialization flaws were discovered in jackson-databind\nrelating to the classes in com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig,\ncom.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource, commons-dbcp and\ncom.p6spy.engine.spy.P6DataSource, which could allow an\nunauthenticated user to perform remote code execution. The issue was\nresolved by extending the blacklist and blocking more classes from\npolymorphic deserialization.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.4.2-2+deb8u9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
