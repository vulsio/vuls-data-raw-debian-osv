	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities were corrected in the libav\nmultimedia library which may lead to a denial-of-service, information\ndisclosure or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed file is\nprocessed.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-9993](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9993)\nLibav does not properly restrict HTTP Live Streaming filename\n extensions and demuxer names, which allows attackers to read\n arbitrary files via crafted playlist data.\n* [CVE-2017-9994](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9994)\nlibavcodec/webp.c in Libav does not ensure that pix\\_fmt is set,\n which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have\n unspecified other impact via a crafted file, related to the\n vp8\\_decode\\_mb\\_row\\_no\\_filter and pred8x8\\_128\\_dc\\_8\\_c functions.\n* [CVE-2017-14055](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14055)\nDenial-of-service in mv\\_read\\_header() due to lack of an EOF (End of\n File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption.\n* [CVE-2017-14056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14056)\nDenial-of-service in rl2\\_read\\_header() due to lack of an EOF\n (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption.\n* [CVE-2017-14057](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14057)\nDenial-of-service in asf\\_read\\_marker() due to lack of an EOF\n (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption.\n* [CVE-2017-14170](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14170)\nDenial-of-service in mxf\\_read\\_index\\_entry\\_array() due to lack of an\n EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption.\n* [CVE-2017-14171](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14171)\nDenial-of-service in nsv\\_parse\\_NSVf\\_header() due to lack of an EOF\n (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption.\n* [CVE-2017-14767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14767)\nThe sdp\\_parse\\_fmtp\\_config\\_h264 function in\n libavformat/rtpdec\\_h264.c mishandles empty sprop-parameter-sets\n values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (heap buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via\n a crafted sdp file.\n* [CVE-2017-15672](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15672)\nThe read\\_header function in libavcodec/ffv1dec.c allows remote\n attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted MP4 file, which\n triggers an out-of-bounds read.\n* [CVE-2017-17130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17130)\nThe ff\\_free\\_picture\\_tables function in libavcodec/mpegpicture.c\n allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have\n unspecified other impact via a crafted file, related to\n vc1\\_decode\\_i\\_blocks\\_adv.\n* [CVE-2018-6621](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6621)\nThe decode\\_frame function in libavcodec/utvideodec.c in Libav allows\n remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out of array read)\n via a crafted AVI file.\n* [CVE-2018-7557](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7557)\nThe decode\\_init function in libavcodec/utvideodec.c in\n Libav allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (Out of array read) via an AVI file with crafted dimensions within\n chroma subsampling data.\n* [CVE-2018-14394](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14394)\nlibavformat/movenc.c in Libav allows attackers to cause a\n denial of service (application crash caused by a divide-by-zero\n error) with a user crafted Waveform audio file.\n* [CVE-2018-1999010](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1999010)\nLibav contains multiple out of array access vulnerabilities in the\n mms protocol that can result in attackers accessing out of bound\n data.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n6:11.12-1~deb8u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libav packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
