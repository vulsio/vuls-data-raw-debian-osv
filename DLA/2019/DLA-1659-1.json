	"summary": "drupal7 - security update",
	"details": "\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in PHP's built-in phar\nstream wrapper when performing file operations on an untrusted phar://\nURI. Some Drupal code (core, contrib, and custom) may be performing\nfile operations on insufficiently validated user input, thereby being\nexposed to this vulnerability.\n\n\nWith this update a new replacement stream wrapper from typo3 project\nis used instead of the built-in one.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n7.32-1+deb8u14.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
