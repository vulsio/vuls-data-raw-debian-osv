An attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional\nattributes, potentially executing code.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n4.0.5-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-haml packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
