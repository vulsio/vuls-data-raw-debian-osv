	"summary": "python2.7 - security update",
	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python, an interactive\nhigh-level object-oriented language, including\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-14647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14647)\nPython's elementtree C accelerator failed to initialise Expat's hash\n salt during initialization. This could make it easy to conduct\n denial of service attacks against Expat by constructing an XML\n document that would cause pathological hash collisions in Expat's\n internal data structures, consuming large amounts CPU and RAM.\n* [CVE-2019-5010](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5010)\nNULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.\n* [CVE-2019-9636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9636)\nImproper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)\n during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure\n (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given\n hostname). A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to\n locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to\n a different host than when parsed correctly.\n* [CVE-2019-9740](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9740)\nAn issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible\n if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the\n first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \\r\\n (specifically in\n the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or\n a Redis command.\n* [CVE-2019-9947](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9947)\nAn issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible\n if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the\n first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \\r\\n (specifically in\n the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an\n HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the [CVE-2019-9740](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9740)\n query string issue.\n* [CVE-2019-9948](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9948)\nurllib supports the local\\_file: scheme, which makes it easier for\n remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist\n file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a\n urllib.urlopen('local\\_file:///etc/passwd') call.\n* [CVE-2019-10160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10160)\nA security regression of [CVE-2019-9636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9636) was discovered which still\n allows an attacker to exploit [CVE-2019-9636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9636) by abusing the user and\n password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied\n URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of\n information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially\n crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information\n (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different\n host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly\n parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.7.9-2+deb8u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
