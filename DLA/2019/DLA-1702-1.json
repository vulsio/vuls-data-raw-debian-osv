This might allow an attacker to cause a\n denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact\n via a crafted file.\n* [CVE-2019-9210](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9210)\nThe png\\_compress function in pngex.cc in advpng has an integer\n overflow upon encountering an invalid PNG size, which results in\n another heap based buffer overflow.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.19-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your advancecomp packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
