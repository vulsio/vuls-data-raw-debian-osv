	"summary": "jackson-databind - security update",
	"details": "\nDeserialization flaws were discovered in jackson-databind relating to\nEHCache and logback/jndi, which could allow an unauthenticated user to\nperform remote code execution. The issue was resolved by extending the\nblacklist and blocking more classes from polymorphic deserialization.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.4.2-2+deb8u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
