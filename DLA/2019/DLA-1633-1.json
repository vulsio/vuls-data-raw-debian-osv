This could lead to arbitrary code\n execution or a denial-of-service.\n* [CVE-2017-10989](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10989)\nSQLite mishandles undersized RTree blobs in a crafted database\n leading to a heap-based buffer over-read or possibly unspecified\n other impact.\n* [CVE-2018-8740](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8740)\nDatabases whose schema is corrupted using a CREATE TABLE AS\n statement could cause a NULL pointer dereference.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n3.8.7.1-1+deb8u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sqlite3 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
