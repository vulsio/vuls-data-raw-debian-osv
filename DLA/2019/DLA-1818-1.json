	"summary": "dbus - security update",
	"details": "\nJoe Vennix discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in dbus, an\nasynchronous inter-process communication system. The implementation of\nthe DBUS\\_COOKIE\\_SHA1 authentication mechanism was susceptible to a\nsymbolic link attack. A local attacker could take advantage of this flaw\nto bypass authentication and connect to a DBusServer with elevated\nprivileges.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.8.22-0+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
