Remote attackers might leverage this vulnerability to\n cause denial of service or any other unspecified impact via crafted Matlab\n matrices.\n* [CVE-2019-11474](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11474)\nThe WritePDBImage function (coders/pdb.c) is affected by a heap-based\n buffer overflow. Remote attackers might leverage this vulnerability to\n cause denial of service or any other unspecified impact via a crafted Palm\n Database file.\n* [CVE-2019-11505](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11505), [CVE-2019-11506](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11506)\nThe XWD module (coders/xwd.c) is affected by multiple heap-based\n buffer overflows and arithmetic exceptions. Remote attackers might leverage\n these various flaws to cause denial of service or any other unspecified\n impact via crafted XWD files.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.3.20-3+deb8u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",
