	"summary": "hsqldb1.8.0 - security update",
	"details": "\nGregor Kopf of Secfault Security GmbH discovered that HSQLDB, a Java SQL\ndatabase engine, allowed the execution of spurious scripting commands in\n.script and .log files. Hsqldb supports a SCRIPT keyword which is normally\nused to record the commands input by the database admin to output such a\nscript. In combination with LibreOffice, an attacker could craft an odb\ncontaining a \"database/script\" file which itself contained a SCRIPT command\nwhere the contents of the file could be written to a new file whose location\nwas determined by the attacker.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1.8.0.10+dfsg-10+deb11u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8.0.10+dfsg-11+deb12u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your hsqldb1.8.0 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of hsqldb1.8.0 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/hsqldb1.8.0](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/hsqldb1.8.0)\n\n\n",
