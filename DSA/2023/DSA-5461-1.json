	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-3390](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3390)\nA use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect\n error path handling may result in denial of service or privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2023-3610](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3610)\nA use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect\n refcount handling on the table and chain destroy path may result in\n denial of service or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2023-20593](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-20593)\nTavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural\n circumstances, a vector register in AMD Zen 2 CPUs may not be\n written to 0 correctly. This flaw allows an attacker to leak\n sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads\n and virtualized guests.\n\n\nFor details please refer to\n <https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html> and\n <https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>\n\n\nThis issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the\n amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.\n However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides\n updates for second generation EPYC CPUs. Various Ryzen CPUs are\n also affected, but no updates are available yet.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed\nin version 5.10.179-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux)\n\n\n",
