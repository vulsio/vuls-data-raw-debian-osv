	"details": "\nA flaw was found in Asterisk, an Open Source Private Branch Exchange. A\nbuffer overflow vulnerability affects users that use PJSIP DNS resolver.\nThis vulnerability is related to\n[CVE-2022-24793](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24793).\nThe difference is that this issue is in parsing the query record\n`parse\\_query()`, while the issue in\n[CVE-2022-24793](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24793)\nis in `parse\\_rr()`. A workaround is to disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config\n(by setting `nameserver\\_count` to zero) or use an external resolver\nimplementation instead.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of asterisk please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/asterisk](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/asterisk)\n\n\n",
