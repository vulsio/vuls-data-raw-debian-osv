	"summary": "hsqldb - security update",
	"details": "\nGregor Kopf of Secfault Security GmbH discovered that HSQLDB, a Java SQL\ndatabase engine, allowed the execution of spurious scripting commands in\n.script and .log files. Hsqldb supports a SCRIPT keyword which is normally\nused to record the commands input by the database admin to output such a\nscript. In combination with LibreOffice, an attacker could craft an odb\ncontaining a \"database/script\" file which itself contained a SCRIPT command\nwhere the contents of the file could be written to a new file whose location\nwas determined by the attacker.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed\nin version 2.5.1-1+deb11u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.7.1-1+deb12u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your hsqldb packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of hsqldb please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/hsqldb](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/hsqldb)\n\n\n",
