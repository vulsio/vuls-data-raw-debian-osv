A malicious CA could take\n advantage of this flaw to deliberately assert invalid certificate\n policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate\n altogether.\n* [CVE-2023-0466](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0466)\nDavid Benjamin discovered that the implementation of the\n X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_add0\\_policy() function does not enable the check\n which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass\n the certificate verification (contrary to its documentation).\n* [CVE-2023-2650](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2650)\nIt was discovered that processing malformed ASN.1 object identifiers\n or data may result in denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1.1n-0+deb11u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openssl please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssl](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssl)\n\n\n",
