	"details": "\nFlorian Picca reported a bug in the charon-tkm daemon in strongSwan an\nIKE/IPsec suite.\n\n\nThe TKM-backed version of the charon IKE daemon (charon-tkm) doesn't\ncheck the length of received Diffie-Hellman public values before copying\nthem to a fixed-size buffer on the stack, causing a buffer overflow that\ncould potentially be exploited for remote code execution by sending a\nspecially crafted and unauthenticated IKE\\_SA\\_INIT message.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed\nin version 5.9.1-1+deb11u4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.9.8-5+deb12u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of strongswan please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan)\n\n\n",
