	"summary": "pmix - security update",
	"details": "\nFrancois Diakhate reported that a race condition in pmix, a library\nimplementing Process Management Interface (PMI) Exascale API, could\nallow a malicious user to obtain ownership of an arbitrary file on the\nfilesystem when parts of the PMIx library are called by a process with\nelevated privileges, resulting in privilege escalation. This may\nhappen under the default configuration of certain workload managers,\nincluding Slurm.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed\nin version 4.0.0-4.1+deb11u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.2.2-1+deb12u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pmix packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of pmix please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pmix](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pmix)\n\n\n",
