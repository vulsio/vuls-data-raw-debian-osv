	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nTavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural\ncircumstances, a vector register in AMD Zen 2 CPUs may not be\nwritten to 0 correctly. This flaw allows an attacker to leak\nsensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads\nand virtualized guests.\n\n\nFor details please refer to\n<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html> and\n<https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>\n\n\nThis issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the\namd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.\nHowever, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides\nupdates for second generation EPYC CPUs. Various Ryzen CPUs are\nalso affected, but no updates are available yet.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.1.38-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux)\n\n\n",
