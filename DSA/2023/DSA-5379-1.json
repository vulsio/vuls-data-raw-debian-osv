	"details": "\nKim Alvefur discovered that insufficient message sender validation in\ndino-im, a modern XMPP/Jabber client, may result in manipulation of\nentries in the personal bookmark store without user interaction via a\nspecially crafted message. Additionally an attacker can take advantage\nof this flaw to change how group chats are displayed or force a user to\njoin or leave an attacker-selected groupchat.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.2.0-3+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dino-im packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of dino-im please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dino-im](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dino-im)\n\n\n",
