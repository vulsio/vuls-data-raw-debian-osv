	"summary": "sudo - security update",
	"details": "\nMatthieu Barjole and Victor Cutillas discovered that sudoedit in sudo, a\nprogram designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific\nusers, does not properly handle '--' to separate the editor and\narguments from files to edit. A local user permitted to edit certain\nfiles can take advantage of this flaw to edit a file not permitted by\nthe security policy, resulting in privilege escalation.\n\n\nDetails can be found in the upstream advisory at\n<https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/sudoedit_any/> .\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.9.5p2-3+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of sudo please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo>\n\n\n",
