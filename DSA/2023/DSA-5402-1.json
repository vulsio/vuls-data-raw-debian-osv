	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-0386](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0386)\nIt was discovered that under certain conditions the overlayfs\n filesystem implementation did not properly handle copy up\n operations. A local user permitted to mount overlay mounts in user\n namespaces can take advantage of this flaw for local privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2023-31436](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31436)\nGwangun Jung reported a a flaw causing heap out-of-bounds read/write\n errors in the traffic control subsystem for the Quick Fair Queueing\n scheduler (QFQ) which may result in information leak, denial of\n service or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2023-32233](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-32233)\nPatryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered a use-after-free flaw in\n the Netfilter nf\\_tables implementation when processing batch\n requests, which may result in local privilege escalation for a user\n with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.10.179-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>\n\n\n",
