	"details": "\nTwo security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Netty, a Java NIO\nclient/server socket framework.\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-34462](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-34462)\nIt might be possible for a remote peer to send a client hello packet\n during a TLS handshake which lead the server to buffer up to 16 MB of data\n per connection. This could lead to a OutOfMemoryError and so result in a\n denial of service.\n* [CVE-2023-44487](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-44487)\nThe HTTP/2 protocol allowed a denial of service (server resource\n consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly.\n This problem is also known as Rapid Reset Attack.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1:4.1.48-4+deb11u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:4.1.48-7+deb12u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your netty packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of netty please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/netty](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/netty)\n\n\n",
