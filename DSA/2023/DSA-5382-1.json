	"summary": "cairosvg - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was reported that cairosvg, a SVG converter based on Cairo, can send\nrequests to external hosts when processing specially crafted SVG files\nwith external file resource loading. An attacker can take advantage of\nthis flaw to perform a server-side request forgery or denial of service.\nFetching of external files is disabled by default with this update.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.5.0-1.1+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cairosvg packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of cairosvg please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cairosvg](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cairosvg)\n\n\n",
