This vulnerability could only be\n triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients. The\n issue does not affect the stretch release.\n* [CVE-2019-10098](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10098)\nYukitsugu Sasaki reported a potential open redirect vulnerability in\n the mod\\_rewrite module.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2.4.25-3+deb9u8.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.38-3+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache2 please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache2>\n\n\n",
