	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTP server.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-17189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17189)\nGal Goldshtein of F5 Networks discovered a denial of service\n vulnerability in mod\\_http2. By sending malformed requests, the\n http/2 stream for that request unnecessarily occupied a server\n thread cleaning up incoming data, resulting in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-17199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17199)\nDiego Angulo from ImExHS discovered that mod\\_session\\_cookie does not\n respect expiry time.\n* [CVE-2019-0196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0196)\nCraig Young discovered that the http/2 request handling in mod\\_http2\n could be made to access freed memory in string comparison when\n determining the method of a request and thus process the request\n incorrectly.\n* [CVE-2019-0211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0211)\nCharles Fol discovered a privilege escalation from the\n less-privileged child process to the parent process running as root.\n* [CVE-2019-0217](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0217)\nA race condition in mod\\_auth\\_digest when running in a threaded\n server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate\n using another username, bypassing configured access control\n restrictions. The issue was discovered by Simon Kappel.\n* [CVE-2019-0220](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0220)\nBernhard Lorenz of Alpha Strike Labs GmbH reported that URL\n normalizations were inconsistently handled. When the path component\n of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'),\n directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for\n duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers\n processing will implicitly collapse them.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.25-3+deb9u7.\n\n\nThis update also contains bug fixes that were scheduled for inclusion in the\nnext stable point release. This includes a fix for a regression caused by a\nsecurity fix in version 2.4.25-3+deb9u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache2 please refer to its security\ntracker page at: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache2>\n\n\n",
