	"details": "\nBenno Fuenfstueck discovered that Pango, a library for layout and\nrendering of text with an emphasis on internationalization, is prone to a\nheap-based buffer overflow flaw in the pango\\_log2vis\\_get\\_embedding\\_levels\nfunction. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw for denial of\nservice or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.42.4-7~deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pango1.0 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of pango1.0 please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pango1.0>\n\n\n",
