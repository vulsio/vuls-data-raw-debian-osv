	"summary": "sudo - security update",
	"details": "\nJoe Vennix discovered that sudo, a program designed to provide limited\nsuper user privileges to specific users, when configured to allow a user\nto run commands as an arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas\nspecification, allows to run commands as root by specifying the user ID\n-1 or 4294967295. This could allow a user with sufficient sudo\nprivileges to run commands as root even if the Runas specification\nexplicitly disallows root access.\n\n\nDetails can be found in the upstream advisory at\n<https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html> .\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1.8.19p1-2.1+deb9u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8.27-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of sudo please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo>\n\n\n",
