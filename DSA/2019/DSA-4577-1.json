	"details": "\nTim DĂźsterhus discovered that haproxy, a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy, did\nnot properly sanitize HTTP headers when converting from HTTP/2 to\nHTTP/1. This would allow a remote user to perform CRLF injections.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8.19-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of haproxy please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy)\n\n\n",
