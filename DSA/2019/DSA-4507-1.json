	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Squid, a fully featured web\nproxy cache. The flaws in the HTTP Digest Authentication processing, the\nHTTP Basic Authentication processing and in the cachemgr.cgi allowed\nremote attackers to perform denial of service and cross-site scripting\nattacks, and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.6-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of squid please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squid>\n\n\n",
