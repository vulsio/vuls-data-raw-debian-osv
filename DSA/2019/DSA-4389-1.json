	"summary": "libu2f-host - security update",
	"details": "\nChristian Reitter discovered that libu2f-host, a library implementing\nthe host-side of the U2F protocol, failed to properly check for a\nbuffer overflow. This would allow an attacker with a custom made\nmalicious USB device masquerading as a security key, and physical\naccess to a computer where PAM U2F or an application with libu2f-host\nintegrated, to potentially execute arbitrary code on that computer.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.2-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libu2f-host packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libu2f-host please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libu2f-host](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libu2f-host)\n\n\n",
