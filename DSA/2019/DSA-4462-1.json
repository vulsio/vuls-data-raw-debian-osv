	"details": "\nJoe Vennix discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in dbus, an\nasynchronous inter-process communication system. The implementation of\nthe DBUS\\_COOKIE\\_SHA1 authentication mechanism was susceptible to a\nsymbolic link attack. A local attacker could take advantage of this flaw\nto bypass authentication and connect to a DBusServer with elevated\nprivileges.\n\n\nThe standard system and session dbus-daemons in their default\nconfiguration are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n\nThe vulnerability was addressed by upgrading dbus to a new upstream\nversion 1.10.28 which includes additional fixes.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.10.28-0+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of dbus please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dbus>\n\n\n",
