	"summary": "pdns - security update",
	"details": "\nAdam Dobrawy, Frederico Silva and Gregory Brzeski from HyperOne.com\ndiscovered that pdns, an authoritative DNS server, did not properly\nvalidate user-supplied data when building a HTTP request from a DNS\nquery in the HTTP Connector of the Remote backend. This would allow a\nremote user to cause either a denial-of-service, or information\ndisclosure.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.3-1+deb9u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of pdns please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pdns](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pdns)\n\n\n",
