	"details": "\nUser Arminius discovered a vulnerability in Vim, an enhanced version of the\nstandard UNIX editor Vi (Vi IMproved), which also affected the Neovim fork, an\nextensible editor focused on modern code and features:\n\n\nEditors typically provide a way to embed editor configuration commands (aka\nmodelines) which are executed once a file is opened, while harmful commands\nare filtered by a sandbox mechanism. It was discovered that the source\ncommand (used to include and execute another file) was not filtered, allowing\nshell command execution with a carefully crafted file opened in Neovim.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed\nin version 0.1.7-4+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your neovim packages.\n\n\n",
