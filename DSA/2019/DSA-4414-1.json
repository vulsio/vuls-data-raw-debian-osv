	"details": "\nSeveral issues have been discovered in Apache module auth\\_mellon, which\nprovides SAML 2.0 authentication.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-3877](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3877)\nIt was possible to bypass the redirect URL checking on logout, so\n the module could be used as an open redirect facility.\n* [CVE-2019-3878](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3878)\nWhen mod\\_auth\\_mellon is used in an Apache configuration which\n serves as a remote proxy with the http\\_proxy module, it was\n possible to bypass authentication by sending SAML ECP headers.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.12.0-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-auth-mellon packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libapache2-mod-auth-mellon please\nrefer to its security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libapache2-mod-auth-mellon](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libapache2-mod-auth-mellon)\n\n\n",
