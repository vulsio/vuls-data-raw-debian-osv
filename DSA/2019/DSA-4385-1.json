	"summary": "dovecot - security update",
	"details": "\nhalfdog discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Dovecot\nemail server. Under some configurations Dovecot mistakenly trusts the\nusername provided via authentication instead of failing. If there is no\nadditional password verification, this allows the attacker to login as\nanyone else in the system. Only installations using:\n\n\n* auth\\_ssl\\_require\\_client\\_cert = yes\n* auth\\_ssl\\_username\\_from\\_cert = yes\n\n\nare affected by this flaw.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.2.27-3+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of dovecot please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dovecot](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dovecot)\n\n\n",
