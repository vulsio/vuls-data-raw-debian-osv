	"details": "\nMathy Vanhoef (NYUAD) and Eyal Ronen (Tel Aviv University & KU Leuven) found\nmultiple vulnerabilities in the WPA implementation found in wpa\\_supplication\n(station) and hostapd (access point). These vulnerability are also collectively\nknown as Dragonblood.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-9495](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9495)\nCache-based side-channel attack against the EAP-pwd implementation: an\n attacker able to run unprivileged code on the target machine (including for\n example javascript code in a browser on a smartphone) during the handshake\n could deduce enough information to discover the password in a dictionary\n attack.\n* [CVE-2019-9497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9497)\nReflection attack against EAP-pwd server implementation: a lack of\n validation of received scalar and elements value in the EAP-pwd-Commit\n messages could result in attacks that would be able to complete EAP-pwd\n authentication exchange without the attacker having to know the password.\n This does not result in the attacker being able to derive the session key,\n complete the following key exchange and access the network.\n* [CVE-2019-9498](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9498)\nEAP-pwd server missing commit validation for scalar/element: hostapd\n doesn't validate values received in the EAP-pwd-Commit message, so an\n attacker could use a specially crafted commit message to manipulate the\n exchange in order for hostapd to derive a session key from a limited set of\n possible values. This could result in an attacker being able to complete\n authentication and gain access to the network.\n* [CVE-2019-9499](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9499)\nEAP-pwd peer missing commit validation for scalar/element: wpa\\_supplicant\n doesn't validate values received in the EAP-pwd-Commit message, so an\n attacker could use a specially crafted commit message to manipulate the\n exchange in order for wpa\\_supplicant to derive a session key from a limited\n set of possible values. This could result in an attacker being able to\n complete authentication and operate as a rogue AP.\n\n\nNote that the Dragonblood moniker also applies to\n[\\\nCVE-2019-9494](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9494) and [\\\nCVE-2014-9496](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9496) which are vulnerabilities in the SAE protocol in WPA3. SAE is not\nenabled in Debian stretch builds of wpa, which is thus not vulnerable by default.\n\n\nDue to the complexity of the backporting process, the fix for these\nvulnerabilities are partial. Users are advised to use strong passwords to\nprevent dictionary attacks or use a 2.7-based version from stretch-backports\n(version above 2:2.7+git20190128+0c1e29f-4).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2:2.4-1+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of wpa please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wpa](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wpa)\n\n\n",
