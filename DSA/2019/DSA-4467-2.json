	"details": "\nUser Arminius discovered a vulnerability in Vim, an enhanced version of the\nstandard UNIX editor Vi (Vi IMproved). The Common vulnerabilities and\nexposures project identifies the following problem:\n\n\nEditors typically provide a way to embed editor configuration commands (aka\nmodelines) which are executed once a file is opened, while harmful commands\nare filtered by a sandbox mechanism. It was discovered that the source\ncommand (used to include and execute another file) was not filtered, allowing\nshell command execution with a carefully crafted file opened in Vim.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:8.0.0197-4+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of vim please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/vim](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/vim)\n\n\n",
