	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-9517](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9517)\nJonathan Looney reported that a malicious client could perform a\n denial of service attack (exhausting h2 workers) by flooding a\n connection with requests and basically never reading responses on\n the TCP connection.\n* [CVE-2019-10081](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10081)\nCraig Young reported that HTTP/2 PUSHes could lead to an overwrite\n of memory in the pushing request's pool, leading to crashes.\n* [CVE-2019-10082](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10082)\nCraig Young reported that the HTTP/2 session handling could be made\n to read memory after being freed, during connection shutdown.\n* [CVE-2019-10092](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10092)\nMatei Mal Badanoiu reported a limited cross-site scripting\n vulnerability in the mod\\_proxy error page.\n* [CVE-2019-10097](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10097)\nDaniel McCarney reported that when mod\\_remoteip was configured to\n use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the PROXY protocol,\n a specially crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer\n overflow or NULL pointer deference. This vulnerability could only be\n triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients. The\n issue does not affect the stretch release.\n* [CVE-2019-10098](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10098)\nYukitsugu Sasaki reported a potential open redirect vulnerability in\n the mod\\_rewrite module.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2.4.25-3+deb9u8.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.38-3+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache2 please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache2>\n\n\n",
