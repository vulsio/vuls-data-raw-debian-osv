	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-14821](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14821)\nMatt Delco reported a race condition in KVM's coalesced MMIO\n facility, which could lead to out-of-bounds access in the kernel.\n A local attacker permitted to access /dev/kvm could use this to\n cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly\n for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-14835](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14835)\nPeter Pi of Tencent Blade Team discovered a missing bounds check\n in vhost\\_net, the network back-end driver for KVM hosts, leading\n to a buffer overflow when the host begins live migration of a VM.\n An attacker in control of a VM could use this to cause a denial of\n service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege\n escalation on the host.\n* [CVE-2019-15117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15117)\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer reported a missing bounds check in the\n usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a buffer\n over-read. An attacker able to add USB devices could possibly use\n this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2019-15118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15118)\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer reported unbounded recursion in the\n usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a stack\n overflow. An attacker able to add USB devices could use this to\n cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly\n for privilege escalation. On the amd64 architecture, and on the\n arm64 architecture in buster, this is mitigated by a guard page\n on the kernel stack, so that it is only possible to cause a crash.\n* [CVE-2019-15902](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15902)\nBrad Spengler reported that a backporting error reintroduced a\n spectre-v1 vulnerability in the ptrace subsystem in the\n ptrace\\_get\\_debugreg() function.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 4.9.189-3+deb9u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.19.67-2+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>\n\n\n",
