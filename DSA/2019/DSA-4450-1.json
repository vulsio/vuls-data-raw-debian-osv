	"summary": "wpa - security update",
	"details": "\nA vulnerability was found in the WPA protocol implementation found in\nwpa\\_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).\n\n\nThe EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server) and wpa\\_supplicant (EAP\npeer) doesn't properly validate fragmentation reassembly state when receiving\nan unexpected fragment. This could lead to a process crash due to a NULL\npointer derefrence.\n\n\nAn attacker in radio range of a station or access point with EAP-pwd support\ncould cause a crash of the relevant process (wpa\\_supplicant or hostapd),\nensuring a denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:2.4-1+deb9u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of wpa please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wpa](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wpa)\n\n\n",
