	"details": "\nThe ESnet security team discovered a vulnerability in rssh, a restricted\nshell that allows users to perform only scp, sftp, cvs, svnserve\n(Subversion), rdist and/or rsync operations. Missing validation in the\nscp support could result in the bypass of this restriction, allowing the\nexecution of arbitrary shell commands.\n\n\nPlease note that with the update applied, the -3 option of scp can no\nlonger be used.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.4-5+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of rssh please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rssh](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rssh)\n\n\n",
