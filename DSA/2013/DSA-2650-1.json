	"summary": "libvirt - files and device nodes ownership change to kvm group",
	"details": "\nBastian Blank discovered that libvirtd, a daemon for management of virtual\nmachines, network and storage, would change ownership of devices files so they\nwould be owned by user libvirt-qemu and group kvm, which is a general\npurpose group not specific to libvirt, allowing unintended write access to\nthose devices and files for the kvm group members.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.3-5+squeeze5.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.12-11.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.12-11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.\n\n\n",
