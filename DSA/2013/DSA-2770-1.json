	"summary": "torque - authentication bypass",
	"details": "\nJohn Fitzpatrick of MWR InfoSecurity discovered an authentication bypass\nvulnerability in torque, a PBS-derived batch processing queueing system.\n\n\nThe torque authentication model revolves around the use of privileged\nports. If a request is not made from a privileged port then it is\nassumed not to be trusted or authenticated. It was found that pbs\\_mom\ndoes not perform a check to ensure that connections are established\nfrom a privileged port.\n\n\nA user who can run jobs or login to a node running pbs\\_server or pbs\\_mom\ncan exploit this vulnerability to remotely execute code as root on the\ncluster by submitting a command directly to a pbs\\_mom daemon\nto queue and run a job.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.\n\n\n",
