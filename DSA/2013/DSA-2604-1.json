	"summary": "rails - insufficient input validation",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Rails, the Ruby web application development\nframework, performed insufficient validation on input parameters,\nallowing unintended type conversions. An attacker may use this to\nbypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and\nexecute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on the application.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze4.1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),\nthis problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.\n\n\n",
