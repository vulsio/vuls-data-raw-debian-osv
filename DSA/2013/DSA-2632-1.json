	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead\nto a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-0231](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0231)\nJan Beulich provided a fix for an issue in the Xen PCI backend drivers.\n Users of guests on a system using passed-through PCI devices can create\n a denial of service of the host system due to the use of non-ratelimited\n kernel log messages.\n* [CVE-2013-0871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0871)\nSuleiman Souhlal and Salman Qazi of Google, with help from Aaron Durbin\n and Michael Davidson of Google, discovered an issue in the\n ptrace subsystem. Due to a race condition with PTRACE\\_SETREGS, local users\n can cause kernel stack corruption and execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version\n2.6.32-48squeeze1.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 6.0 (squeeze) |\n| --- | --- |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.32-1um-4+48squeeze1 |\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.\n\n\n",
