	"details": "\nKevin Wojtysiak discovered a vulnerability in strongSwan, an IPsec\nbased VPN solution.\n\n\nWhen using the OpenSSL plugin for ECDSA based authentication, an empty,\nzeroed or otherwise invalid signature is handled as a legitimate one.\nAn attacker could use a forged signature to authenticate like a legitimate\nuser and gain access to the VPN (and everything protected by this).\n\n\nWhile the issue looks like [CVE-2012-2388](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2388)\n(RSA signature based authentication bypass), it is unrelated.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.4.1-5.3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.6.4-7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\n",
