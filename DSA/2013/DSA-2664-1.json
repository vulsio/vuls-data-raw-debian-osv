	"summary": "stunnel4 - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nStunnel, a program designed to work as an universal SSL tunnel for\nnetwork daemons, is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability when using\nthe Microsoft NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication\n(protocolAuthentication = NTLM) together with the connect\nprotocol method (protocol = connect). With these prerequisites\nand using stunnel4 in SSL client mode (client = yes) on a 64 bit\nhost, an attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the stunnel process, if the attacker can either control\nthe specified proxy server or perform man-in-the-middle attacks on the\ntcp session between stunnel and the proxy sever.\n\n\nNote that for the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable\ndistribution (sid), stunnel4 is compiled with stack smashing protection\nenabled, which should help protect against arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3:4.29-1+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3:4.53-1.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3:4.53-1.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your stunnel4 packages.\n\n\n",
