	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Chromium web browser.\nMultiple use-after-free, out-of-bounds read, memory safety, and\ncross-site scripting issues were discovered and corrected.\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-2837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2837)\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the SVG implementation allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified\n other impact via unknown vectors.\n* [CVE-2013-2838](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2838)\nGoogle V8, as used in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93, allows\n remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)\n via unspecified vectors.\n* [CVE-2013-2839](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2839)\nChromium before 27.0.1453.93 does not properly perform a cast\n of an unspecified variable during handling of clipboard data, which\n allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly\n have other impact via unknown vectors.\n* [CVE-2013-2840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2840)\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the media loader in Chromium\n before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown\n vectors, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2013-2846](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2846).\n* [CVE-2013-2841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2841)\nUse-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93\n allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly\n have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of\n Pepper resources.\n* [CVE-2013-2842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2842)\nUse-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93\n allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly\n have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of\n widgets.\n* [CVE-2013-2843](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2843)\nUse-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93\n allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly\n have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of\n speech data.\n* [CVE-2013-2844](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2844)\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\n implementation in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified\n other impact via vectors related to style resolution.\n* [CVE-2013-2845](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2845)\nThe Web Audio implementation in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93\n allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory\n corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown\n vectors.\n* [CVE-2013-2846](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2846)\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the media loader in Chromium\n before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown\n vectors, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2013-2840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2840).\n* [CVE-2013-2847](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2847)\nRace condition in the workers implementation in Chromium before\n 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (use-after-free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified\n other impact via unknown vectors.\n* [CVE-2013-2848](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2848)\nThe XSS Auditor in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 might allow\n remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified\n vectors.\n* [CVE-2013-2849](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2849)\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Chromium\n before 27.0.1453.93 allow user-assisted remote attackers to inject\n arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving a (1)\n drag-and-drop or (2) copy-and-paste operation.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), the security support window\nfor Chromium has ended. Users of Chromium on oldstable are very highly\nencouraged to upgrade to the current stable Debian release (wheezy).\nChromium security support for wheezy will last until the next stable\nrelease (jessie), which is expected to happen sometime in 2015.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 27.0.1453.93-1~deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 27.0.1453.93-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your chromium-browser packages.\n\n\n",
