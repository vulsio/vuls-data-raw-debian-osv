	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-1918](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1918)\n\n([XSA\n45](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-05/msg00000.html)) several long latency operations are not preemptible.\n\n\n\nSome page table manipulation operations for PV guests were not made\n preemptible, allowing a malicious or buggy PV guest kernel to mount a\n denial of service attack affecting the whole system.\n* [CVE-2013-1952](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1952)\n\n([XSA\n49](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-05/msg00001.html)) VT-d interrupt remapping source validation flaw for bridges.\n\n\n\nDue to missing source validation on interrupt remapping table\n entries for MSI interrupts set up by bridge devices, a malicious\n domain with access to such a device can mount a denial of service\n attack affecting the whole system.\n* [CVE-2013-1964](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1964)\n\n([XSA\n50](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-04/msg00006.html)) grant table hypercall acquire/release imbalance.\n\n\n\nWhen releasing a particular, non-transitive grant after doing a grant\n copy operation, Xen incorrectly releases an unrelated grant\n reference, leading possibly to a crash of the host system.\n Furthermore information leakage or privilege escalation cannot be\n ruled out.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.0.1-5.11.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.1.4-3+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.1.4-4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.1.4-4.\n\n\nNote that for the stable (wheezy), testing and unstable distribution,\n[CVE-2013-1964](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1964)\n([XSA\n50](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-04/msg00006.html)) was already fixed in version 4.1.4-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.\n\n\n",
