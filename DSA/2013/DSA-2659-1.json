	"summary": "libapache-mod-security - XML external entity processing vulnerability",
	"details": "\nTimur Yunusov and Alexey Osipov from Positive Technologies discovered\nthat the XML files parser of ModSecurity, an Apache module whose purpose\nis to tighten the Web application security, is vulnerable to XML\nexternal entities attacks. A specially-crafted XML file provided by a\nremote attacker, could lead to local file disclosure or excessive\nresources (CPU, memory) consumption when processed.\n\n\nThis update introduces a SecXmlExternalEntity option which is Off\nby default. This will disable the ability of libxml2 to load external\nentities.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.5.12-1+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.6-6 of the modsecurity-apache package.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.6-6 of the modsecurity-apache package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-security packages.\n\n\n",
