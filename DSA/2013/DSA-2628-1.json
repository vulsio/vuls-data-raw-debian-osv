	"summary": "nss-pam-ldapd - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nGarth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the\nuse of FD\\_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd, which provides NSS and PAM modules for\nusing LDAP as a naming service, can lead to a stack-based buffer\noverflow. An attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to\ncause a process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or\npotentially execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.7.15+squeeze4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.10-3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.10-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nss-pam-ldapd packages.\n\n\n",
