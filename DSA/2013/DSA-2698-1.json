This could\n potentially lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.\n* [CVE-2013-1961](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1961)\nEmmanuel Bouillon discovered many stack-based buffer overflows in\n the TIFF tools. These issues could potentially lead to a crash or\n arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.9.4-5+squeeze9.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.0.2-6+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.0.2-6+nmu1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.\n\n\n",
