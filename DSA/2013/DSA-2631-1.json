A remote attacker still could exploit this flaw\n to perform a denial of service attack.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.1.6-1.2+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.1.20-2.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.1.20-2.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.\n\n\n",
