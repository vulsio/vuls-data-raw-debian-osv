	"details": "\nLawrence Pit discovered that Ruby on Rails, a web development framework,\nis vulnerable to a flaw in the parsing of JSON to YAML. Using a specially\ncrafted payload attackers can trick the backend into decoding a subset of\nYAML.\n\n\nThe vulnerability has been addressed by removing the YAML backend and\nadding the OkJson backend.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze6.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.14-6 of the ruby-activesupport-2.3 package.\n\n\nThe 3.2 version of rails as found in Debian wheezy and sid is not\naffected by the problem.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.\n\n\n",
