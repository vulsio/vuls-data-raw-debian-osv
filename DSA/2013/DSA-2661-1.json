	"summary": "xorg-server - information disclosure",
	"details": "\nDavid Airlie and Peter Hutterer of Red Hat discovered that xorg-server,\nthe X.Org X server was vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw\nrelated to input handling and devices hotplug.\n\n\nWhen an X server is running but not on front (for example because of a VT\nswitch), a newly plugged input device would still be recognized and\nhandled by the X server, which would actually transmit input events to\nits clients on the background.\n\n\nThis could allow an attacker to recover some input events not intended\nfor the X clients, including sensitive information.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:1.7.7-16.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:1.12.4-6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:1.12.4-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.\n\n\n",
