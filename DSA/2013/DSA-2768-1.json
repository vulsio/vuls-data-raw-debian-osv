	"details": "\nA heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in icedtea-web, a\nweb browser plugin for running applets written in the Java programming\nlanguage. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an\nattacker could cause the plugin to crash or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode as the user invoking the program.\n\n\nThis problem was initially discovered by Arthur Gerkis and got assigned\n[CVE-2012-4540](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4540). Fixes where applied in the 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 branches but\nnot to the 1.4 branch.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4-3~deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4-3.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your icedtea-web packages.\n\n\n",
