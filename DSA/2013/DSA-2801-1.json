	"details": "\nJonathan Dolle reported a design error in HTTP::Body, a Perl module for\nprocessing data from HTTP POST requests. The HTTP body multipart parser\ncreates temporary files which preserve the suffix of the uploaded file.\nAn attacker able to upload files to a service that uses\nHTTP::Body::Multipart could potentially execute commands on the server\nif these temporary filenames are used in subsequent commands without\nfurther checks.\n\n\nThis update restricts the possible suffixes used for the created\ntemporary files.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.11-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.17-2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.17-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libhttp-body-perl packages.\n\n\n",
