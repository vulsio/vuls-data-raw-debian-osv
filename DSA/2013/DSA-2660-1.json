	"summary": "curl - cookie leak vulnerability",
	"details": "\nYamada Yasuharu discovered that cURL, an URL transfer library, is\nvulnerable to expose potentially sensitive information when doing\nrequests across domains with matching tails. Due to a bug in the\ntailmatch function when matching domain names, it was possible that\ncookies set for a domain ample.com could accidentally also be sent\nby libcurl when communicating with example.com.\n\n\nBoth curl the command line tool and applications using the libcurl\nlibrary are vulnerable.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.26.0-1+wheezy2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.29.0-2.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\n",
