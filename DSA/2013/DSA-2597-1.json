	"summary": "rails - input validation error",
	"details": "\njoernchen of Phenoelit discovered that rails, an MVC ruby based framework\ngeared for web application development, is not properly treating\nuser-supplied input to find\\_by\\_\\* methods. Depending on how the\nruby on rails application is using these methods, this allows an attacker\nto perform SQL injection attacks, e.g., to bypass authentication if\nAuthlogic is used and the session secret token is known.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nruby-activerecord-2.3 version 2.3.14-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rails/ruby-activerecord-2.3 packages.\n\n\n",
