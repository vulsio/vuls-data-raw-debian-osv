	"details": "\nHelmut Grohne discovered multiple privilege escalation flaws in FusionForge, a\nweb-based project-management and collaboration software. Most of the\nvulnerabilities are related to the bad handling of privileged operations on\nuser-controlled files or directories.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.0.2-5+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distribution, these problems will\nbe fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your fusionforge packages.\n\n\n",
