	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Rack, a modular Ruby\nwebserver interface. The Common Vulnerabilites and Exposures project\nidentifies the following vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-5036](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-5036)\nRack computes hash values for form parameters without restricting\n the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows\n remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)\n by sending many crafted parameters.\n* [CVE-2013-0183](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0183)\nA remote attacker could cause a denial of service (memory\n consumption and out-of-memory error) via a long string in a\n Multipart HTTP packet.\n* [CVE-2013-0184](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0184)\nA vulnerability in Rack::Auth::AbstractRequest allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service via unknown vectors.\n* [CVE-2013-0263](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0263)\nRack::Session::Cookie allows remote attackers to guess the\n session cookie, gain privileges, and execute arbitrary code via a\n timing attack involving an HMAC comparison function that does not\n run in constant time.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1.0-4+squeeze1.\n\n\nThe stable, testing and unstable distributions do not contain the\nlibrack-ruby package. They have already been addressed in version\n1.4.1-2.1 of the ruby-rack package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your librack-ruby packages.\n\n\n",
