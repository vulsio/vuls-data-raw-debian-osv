	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FreeBSD kernel that may\nlead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-5691](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5691)\nLoganaden Velvindron and Gleb Smirnoff discovered that the SIOCSIFADDR,\n SIOCSIFBRDADDR, SIOCSIFDSTADDR and SIOCSIFNETMASK ioctl requests do not\n perform input validation or verify the caller's credentials.\n Unprivileged user with the ability to run arbitrary code can cause any\n network interface in the system to perform the link layer actions\n associated with the above ioctl requests or trigger a kernel panic by\n passing a specially crafted address structure which causes a network\n interface driver to dereference an invalid pointer.\n* [CVE-2013-5710](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5710)\nKonstantin Belousov discovered that the nullfs(5) implementation of the\n VOP\\_LINK(9) VFS operation does not check whether the source and target of\n the link are both in the same nullfs instance. It is therefore possible to\n create a hardlink from a location in one nullfs instance to a file in\n another, as long as the underlying (source) filesystem is the same. If\n multiple nullfs views into the same filesystem are mounted in different\n locations, a user may gain write access to files which are nominally on\n a read-only filesystem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 9.0-10+deb70.4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.\n\n\n",
