	"summary": "tinc - stack based buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nMartin Schobert discovered a stack-based vulnerability in tinc, a\nVirtual Private Network (VPN) daemon.\n\n\nWhen packets are forwarded via TCP, packet length is not checked against\nthe stack buffer length. Authenticated peers could use this to crash the\ntinc daemon and maybe execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nNote that on Wheezy and Sid, tinc is built using hardening flags and\nespecially stack smashing protection, which should help protect against\narbitrary code execution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.13-1+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.19-3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.19-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tinc packages.\n\n\n",
