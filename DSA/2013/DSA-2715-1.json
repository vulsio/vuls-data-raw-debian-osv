A remote attacker could\nuse a specially-crafted payload to execute arbitrary code on the puppet\nmaster.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed in\nversion 2.6.2-5+squeeze8.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.7.18-5.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.2.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.\n\n\n",
