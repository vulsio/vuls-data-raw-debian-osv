	"summary": "lighttpd - fixed socket name in world-writable directory",
	"details": "\nStefan BĂźhler discovered that the Debian specific configuration file for\nlighttpd webserver FastCGI PHP support used a fixed socket name in the\nworld-writable /tmp directory. A symlink attack or a race condition could be\nexploited by a malicious user on the same machine to take over the PHP control\nsocket and for example force the webserver to use a different PHP version.\n\n\nAs the fix is in a configuration file lying in /etc, the update won't be\nenforced if the file has been modified by the administrator. In that case, care\nshould be taken to manually apply the fix.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.31-4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.31-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.\n\n\n",
