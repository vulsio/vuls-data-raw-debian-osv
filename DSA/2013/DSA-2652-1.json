	"summary": "libxml2 - external entity expansion",
	"details": "\nBrad Hill of iSEC Partners discovered that many XML implementations are\nvulnerable to external entity expansion issues, which can be used for\nvarious purposes such as firewall circumvention, disguising an IP\naddress, and denial-of-service. libxml2 was susceptible to these\nproblems when performing string substitution during entity expansion.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.7.8.dfsg-2+squeeze7.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, these problems\nhave been fixed in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.\n\n\n",
