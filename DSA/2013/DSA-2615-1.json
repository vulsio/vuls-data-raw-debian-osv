	"details": "\nMultiple stack-based buffer overflows were discovered in libupnp4, a library\nused for handling the Universal Plug and Play protocol. HD Moore from Rapid7\ndiscovered that SSDP queries where not correctly handled by the\nunique\\_service\\_name() function.\n\n\nAn attacker sending carefully crafted SSDP queries to a daemon built on\nlibupnp4 could generate a buffer overflow, overwriting the stack, leading to\nthe daemon crash and possible remote code execution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.8.0~svn20100507-1+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.8.0~svn20100507-1.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.8.0~svn20100507-1.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libupnp4 packages.\n\n\n",
