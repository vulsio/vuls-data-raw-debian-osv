	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Apache Commons FileUpload, a package to make it\neasy to add robust, high-performance, file upload capability to servlets\nand web applications, incorrectly handled file names with NULL bytes in\nserialized instances. A remote attacker able to supply a serialized\ninstance of the DiskFileItem class, which will be deserialized on a\nserver, could use this flaw to write arbitrary content to any location\non the server that is accessible to the user running the application\nserver process.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.2-1+deb6u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.2-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3-2.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3-2.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libcommons-fileupload-java packages.\n\n\n",
