	"details": "\nNick Brunn reported a possible cross-site scripting vulnerability in\npython-django, a high-level Python web development framework.\n\n\nThe is\\_safe\\_url utility function used to validate that a used URL is on\nthe current host to avoid potentially dangerous redirects from\nmaliciously-constructed querystrings, worked as intended for HTTP and\nHTTPS URLs, but permitted redirects to other schemes, such as\njavascript:.\n\n\nThe is\\_safe\\_url function has been modified to properly recognize and\nreject URLs which specify a scheme other than HTTP or HTTPS, to prevent\ncross-site scripting attacks through redirecting to other schemes.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.3-3+squeeze6.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.5-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.5.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\n",
