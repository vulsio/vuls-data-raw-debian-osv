	"details": "\nRobert Matthews discovered that the Apache FCGID module, a FastCGI\nimplementation for Apache HTTP Server, fails to perform adequate\nboundary checks on user-supplied input. This may allow a remote attacker\nto cause a heap-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service\nor potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.3.6-1+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.3.6-1.2+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.3.9-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-fcgid packages.\n\n\n",
