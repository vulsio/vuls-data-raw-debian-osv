This was later passed to a pipe,\nmaking it possible for these commands to be executed as root on the\npbs\\_server.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.16+dfsg-1.3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.\n\n\n",
