	"summary": "ejabberd - insecure SSL usage",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that ejabberd, a Jabber/XMPP server, uses SSLv2 and\nweak ciphers for communication, which are considered insecure. The\nsoftware offers no runtime configuration options to disable these. This\nupdate disables the use of SSLv2 and weak ciphers.\n\n\nThe updated package for Debian 7 (wheezy) also contains auxiliary\nbugfixes originally staged for the next stable point release.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.5-3+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.10-4+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), and unstable distribution (sid),\nthis problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ejabberd packages.\n\n\n",
