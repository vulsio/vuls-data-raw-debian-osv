	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control\nsystem. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-1968](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1968)\nSubversion repositories with the FSFS repository data store format\n can be corrupted by newline characters in filenames. A remote\n attacker with a malicious client could use this flaw to disrupt the\n service for other users using that repository.\n* [CVE-2013-2112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2112)\nSubversion's svnserve server process may exit when an incoming TCP\n connection is closed early in the connection process. A remote\n attacker can cause svnserve to exit and thus deny service to users\n of the server.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.12dfsg-7.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.17dfsg-4+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.\n\n\n",
