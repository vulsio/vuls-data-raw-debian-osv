	"details": "\nHelmut Grohne discovered that denyhosts, a tool preventing SSH\nbrute-force attacks, could be used to perform remote denial of service\nagainst the SSH daemon. Incorrectly specified regular expressions used\nto detect brute force attacks in authentication logs could be exploited\nby a malicious user to forge crafted login names in order to make\ndenyhosts ban arbitrary IP addresses.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6-7+deb6u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6-10+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6-10.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6-10.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your denyhosts packages.\n\n\n",
