The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-1635](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1635)\nIf a PHP application accepted untrusted SOAP object input remotely\n from clients, an attacker could read system files readable for the\n webserver.\n* [CVE-2013-1643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1643)\nThe soap.wsdl\\_cache\\_dir function did not take PHP open\\_basedir\n restrictions into account. Note that Debian advises against relying\n on open\\_basedir restrictions for security.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.3.3-7+squeeze15.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.4.4-14.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.\n\n\n",
