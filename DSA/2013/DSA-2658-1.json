Anyone with access to the\n port the PostgreSQL server listens on can initiate this request.\n* [CVE-2013-1900](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1900)\nRandom numbers generated by contrib/pgcrypto functions may be easy for\n another database user to guess.\n* [CVE-2013-1901](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1901)\nAn unprivileged user could run commands that could interfere with\n in-progress backups.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), postgresql-9.1 is not available.\n[DSA-2657-1](dsa-2657) has been released for [CVE-2013-1900](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1900)\naffecting posgresql-8.4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 9.1.9-0wheezy1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 9.1.9-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.1 packages.\n\n\n",
