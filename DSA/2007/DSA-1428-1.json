	"details": "\nSeveral local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux\nkernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary\ncode. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\nThis is an update to DSA 1428-1 which omitted a reference to CVE-2007-5904.\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-3104](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3104)\nEric Sandeen provided a backport of Tejun Heo's fix for a local denial\n of service vulnerability in sysfs. Under memory pressure, a dentry\n structure maybe reclaimed resulting in a bad pointer dereference causing\n an oops during a readdir.\n* [CVE-2007-4997](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4997)\nChris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that make use of the\n Linux kernel's ieee80211 layer. A remote user could generate a malicious\n 802.11 frame that could result in a denial of service (crash). The ipw2100\n driver is known to be affected by this issue, while the ipw2200 is\n believed not to be.\n* [CVE-2007-5500](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5500)\nScott James Remnant diagnosed a coding error in the implementation of\n ptrace which could be used by a local user to cause the kernel to enter\n an infinite loop.\n* [CVE-2007-5904](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5904)\nPrzemyslaw Wegrzyn discovered an issue in the CIFS filesystem that could\n allow a malicious server to cause a denial of service (crash) by overflowing\n a buffer.\n\n\nThese problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version \n2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch5.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 4.0 (etch) |\n| --- | --- |\n| fai-kernels | 1.17+etch.13etch5 |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.18-1um-2etch.13etch5 |\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot\nthe machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source\npackage, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.\n\n\n",
