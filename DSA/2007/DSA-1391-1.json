	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Icedove mail client,\nan unbranded version of the Thunderbird client. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-3734](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3734)\nBernd Mielke, Boris Zbarsky, David Baron, Daniel Veditz, Jesse Ruderman,\n Lukas Loehrer, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren, Olli Pettay, Paul\n Nickerson and Vladimir Sukhoy discovered crashes in the layout engine,\n which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-3735](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3735)\nAsaf Romano, Jesse Ruderman and Igor Bukanov discovered crashes in the\n JavaScript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-3844](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3844)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered that a regression in the handling of\n about:blank windows used by addons may lead to an attacker being\n able to modify the content of web sites.\n* [CVE-2007-3845](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3845)\nJesper Johansson discovered that missing sanitising of double-quotes\n and spaces in URIs passed to external programs may allow an attacker\n to pass arbitrary arguments to the helper program if the user is\n tricked into opening a malformed web page.\n* [CVE-2007-5339](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5339)\nL. David Baron, Boris Zbarsky, Georgi Guninski, Paul Nickerson, Olli Pettay,\n Jesse Ruderman, Vladimir Sukhoy, Daniel Veditz, and Martijn Wargers discovered\n crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-5340](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5340)\nIgor Bukanov, Eli Friedman, and Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes in the\n JavaScript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code. Generally,\n enabling Javascript in Icedove is not recommended.\n\n\nThe Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution (sarge) are no longer\nsupported with security updates.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version\n1.5.0.13+1.5.0.14b.dfsg1-0etch1. Builds for hppa will be provided later.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.\n\n\n",
