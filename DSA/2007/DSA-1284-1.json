	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the QEMU processor\nemulator, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of\nservice. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-1320](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1320)\nTavis Ormandy discovered that a memory management routine of the Cirrus\n video driver performs insufficient bounds checking, which might\n allow the execution of arbitrary code through a heap overflow.\n* [CVE-2007-1321](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1321)\nTavis Ormandy discovered that the NE2000 network driver and the socket\n code perform insufficient input validation, which might allow the\n execution of arbitrary code through a heap overflow.\n* [CVE-2007-1322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1322)\nTavis Ormandy discovered that the icebp instruction can be abused to\n terminate the emulation, resulting in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2007-1323](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1323)\nTavis Ormandy discovered that the NE2000 network driver and the socket\n code perform insufficient input validation, which might allow the\n execution of arbitrary code through a heap overflow.\n* [CVE-2007-1366](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1366)\nTavis Ormandy discovered that the aam instruction can be abused to\n crash qemu through a division by zero, resulting in denial of\n service.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.6.1+20050407-1sarge1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.8.2-4etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.\n\n\n",
