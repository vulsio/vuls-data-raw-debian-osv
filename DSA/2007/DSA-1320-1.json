The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-2650](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2650)\nIt was discovered that the OLE2 parser can be tricked into an infinite\n loop and memory exhaustion.\n* [CVE-2007-3023](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3023)\nIt was discovered that the NsPack decompression code performed\n insufficient sanitising on an internal length variable, resulting in\n a potential buffer overflow.\n* [CVE-2007-3024](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3024)\nIt was discovered that temporary files were created with insecure\n permissions, resulting in information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2007-3122](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3122)\nIt was discovered that the decompression code for RAR archives allows\n bypassing a scan of a RAR archive due to insufficient validity checks.\n* [CVE-2007-3123](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3123)\nIt was discovered that the decompression code for RAR archives performs\n insufficient validation of header values, resulting in a buffer overflow.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.84-2.sarge.17. Please note that the fix for [CVE-2007-3024](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3024) hasn't\nbeen backported to oldstable.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.90.1-3etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.90.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages. An updated package\nfor oldstable/powerpc is not yet available. It will be provided later.\n\n\n",
