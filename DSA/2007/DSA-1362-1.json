	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in lighttpd, a fast webserver with\nminimal memory footprint, which could allow the execution of arbitrary code via\nthe overflow of CGI variables when mod\\_fcgi was enabled. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-3946](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3946)\nThe use of mod\\_auth could leave to a denial of service attack crashing\n the webserver.\n* [CVE-2007-3947](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3947)\nThe improper handling of repeated HTTP headers could cause a denial\n of service attack crashing the webserver.\n* [CVE-2007-3949](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3949)\nA bug in mod\\_access potentially allows remote users to bypass\n access restrictions via trailing slash characters.\n* [CVE-2007-3950](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3950)\nOn 32-bit platforms users may be able to create denial of service\n attacks, crashing the webserver, via mod\\_webdav, mod\\_fastcgi, or\n mod\\_scgi.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version\n1.4.13-4etch4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.16-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd package.\n\n\n",
