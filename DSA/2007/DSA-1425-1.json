The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-5947](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5947)\nJesse Ruderman and Petko D. Petkov discovered that the URI handler\n for JAR archives allows cross-site scripting.\n* [CVE-2007-5959](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5959)\nSeveral crashes in the layout engine were discovered, which might\n allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-5960](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5960)\nGregory Fleischer discovered a race condition in the handling of\n the window.location property, which might lead to cross-site\n request forgery.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain xulrunner.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.8.0.14~pre071019c-0etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.8.1.11-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.\n\n\n",
