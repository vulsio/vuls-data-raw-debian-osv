	"details": "\nA problem has been discovered in the processing of chat messages.\nOverly long messages are truncated by the server to a fixed length,\nwithout paying attention to the multibyte characters. This leads to\ninvalid UTF-8 on clients and causes an uncaught exception. Note that\nboth wesnoth and the wesnoth server are affected.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.0-6 and in version 1.2.7-1~bpo31+1 of sarge-backports.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2-2 and in version 1.2.7-1~bpo40+1 of etch-backports.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.7-1.\n\n\nPackages for the oldstable mips architecture will be added to the\narchive later.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wesnoth packages.\n\n\n",
