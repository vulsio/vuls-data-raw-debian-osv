The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-5162](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5162)\nIt was discovered that the Ruby HTTP(S) module performs insufficient\n validation of SSL certificates, which may lead to man-in-the-middle\n attacks.\n* [CVE-2007-5770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5770)\nIt was discovered that the Ruby modules for FTP, Telnet, IMAP, POP\n and SMTP perform insufficient validation of SSL certificates, which\n may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.1.4a-1sarge1. Packages for sparc will be provided later.\n\n\nThe stable distribution (etch) no longer contains libopenssl-ruby.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libopenssl-ruby packages.\n\n\n",
