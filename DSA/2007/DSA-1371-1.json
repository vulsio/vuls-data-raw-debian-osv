The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-2024](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2024)\n\n It was discovered that phpWiki performs insufficient file name \n validation, which allows unrestricted file uploads.\n* [CVE-2007-2025](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2025)\n\n It was discovered that phpWiki performs insufficient file name \n validation, which allows unrestricted file uploads.\n* [CVE-2007-3193](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3193)\n\n If the configuration lacks a nonzero PASSWORD\\_LENGTH\\_MINIMUM,\n phpWiki might allow remote attackers to bypass authentication via\n an empty password, which causes ldap\\_bind to return true when used\n with certain LDAP implementations.\n\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain phpwiki packages.\n\n\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.12p3-5etch1.\n\n\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.12p3-6.1.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpwiki package.\n\n\n\n",
