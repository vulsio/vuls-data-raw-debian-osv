	"details": "\nSeveral local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux\nkernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary\ncode. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-1496](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1496)\nMichal Miroslaw reported a DoS vulnerability (crash) in netfilter.\n A remote attacker can cause a NULL pointer dereference in the\n nfnetlink\\_log function.\n* [CVE-2007-1497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1497)\nPatrick McHardy reported an vulnerability in netfilter that may\n allow attackers to bypass certain firewall rules. The nfctinfo\n value of reassembled IPv6 packet fragments were incorrectly initialized\n to 0 which allowed these packets to become tracked as ESTABLISHED.\n* [CVE-2007-1861](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1861)\nJaco Kroon reported a bug in which NETLINK\\_FIB\\_LOOKUP packages were\n incorrectly routed back to the kernel resulting in an infinite\n recursion condition. Local users can exploit this behavior\n to cause a DoS (crash).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version \n2.6.18.dfsg.1-12etch2.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 4.0 (etch) |\n| --- | --- |\n| fai-kernels | 1.17+etch2 |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.18-1um-2etch2 |\n| kernel-patch-openvz | 028.18.1etch1 |\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot\nthe machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source\npackage, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.\n\n\n",
