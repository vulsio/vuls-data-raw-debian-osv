	],
	"summary": "php4",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that the ftp extension of PHP, a server-side,\nHTML-embedded scripting language performs insufficient input sanitising,\nwhich permits an attacker to execute arbitrary FTP commands. This\nrequires the attacker to already have access to the FTP server.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed\nin version 4.3.10-21.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed\nin version 4.4.4-8+etch3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem won't be fixed, as php4\nwill be removed from sid; thus you are strongly advised to migrate to\nphp5 if you prefer to follow the unstable distribution.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages. Packages for the Sparc\narchitectures are not yet available, due to problems on the build host. They\nwill be provided later.\n\n\n",
