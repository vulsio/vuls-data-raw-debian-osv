	"summary": "linux-2.6 - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\n\n \nSeveral local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux\nkernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary\ncode. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-1353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1353)\nIlja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the\n Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This\n could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel\n memory.\n* [CVE-2007-2172](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2172)\nThomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could\n be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,\n potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).\n A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed\n in a subsequent update.\n* [CVE-2007-2453](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2453)\nA couple of issues with random number generation were discovered.\n Slightly less random numbers resulted from hashing a subset of the\n available entropy. Zero-entropy systems were seeded with the same\n inputs at boot time, resulting in repeatable series of random numbers.\n* [CVE-2007-2525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2525)\nFlorian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused\n by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could\n be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.\n* [CVE-2007-2876](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2876)\nVilmos Nebehaj discovered a NULL pointer dereference condition in the\n netfilter subsystem. This allows remote systems which communicate using\n the SCTP protocol to crash a system by creating a connection with an\n unknown chunk type.\n* [CVE-2007-3513](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3513)\nOliver Neukum reported an issue in the usblcd driver which, by not\n limiting the size of write buffers, permits local users with write access\n to trigger a DoS by consuming all available memory.\n* [CVE-2007-3642](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3642)\nZhongling Wen reported an issue in nf\\_conntrack\\_h323 where the lack of\n range checking may lead to NULL pointer dereferences. Remote attackers\n could exploit this to create a DoS condition (system crash).\n* [CVE-2007-3848](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3848)\nWojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath\\_signal was not being reset\n properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain\n privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.\n* [CVE-2007-3851](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3851)\nDave Airlie reported that Intel 965 and above chipsets have relocated\n their batch buffer security bits. Local X server users may exploit this\n to write user data to arbitrary physical memory addresses.\n\n\nThese problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version \n2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch1.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 4.0 (etch) |\n| --- | --- |\n| fai-kernels | 1.17+etch4 |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.18-1um-2etch3 |\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot\nthe machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source\npackage, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.\n\n\n",
