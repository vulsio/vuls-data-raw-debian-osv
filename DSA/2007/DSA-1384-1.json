The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-4993](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4993)\nBy use of a specially crafted grub configuration file a domU user\n may be able to execute arbitrary code upon the dom0 when pygrub is\n being used.\n* [CVE-2007-1320](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1320)\nMultiple heap-based buffer overflows in the Cirrus VGA extension,\n provided by QEMU, may allow local users to execute arbitrary code\n via bitblt heap overflow.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version\n3.0.3-0-3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xen-utils package.\n\n\n",
