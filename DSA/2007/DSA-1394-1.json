	"summary": "reprepro - authentication bypass",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that reprepro, a tool to create a repository of Debian\npackages, only checks the validity of known signatures when updating\nfrom a remote site, and thus does not reject packages with only unknown\nsignatures. This allows an attacker to bypass this authentication\nmechanism.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.1+1-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your reprepro package.\n\n\n",
