	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceape internet\nsuite, an unbranded version of the Seamonkey Internet Suite. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-1362](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1362)\nNicolas Derouet discovered that Iceape performs insufficient \n validation of cookies, which could lead to denial of service.\n* [CVE-2007-1558](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1558)\nGatan Leurent discovered a cryptographical weakness in APOP\n authentication, which reduces the required efforts for an MITM attack\n to intercept a password. The update enforces stricter validation, which\n prevents this attack.\n* [CVE-2007-2867](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2867)\nBoris Zbarsky, Eli Friedman, Georgi Guninski, Jesse Ruderman, Martijn\n Wargers and Olli Pettay discovered crashes in the layout engine, which\n might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-2868](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2868)\nBrendan Eich, Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman, moz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 and Wladimir Palant\n discovered crashes in the javascript engine, which might allow the execution of\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-2870](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2870)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered that adding an event listener through the\n addEventListener() function allows cross-site scripting.\n* [CVE-2007-2871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2871)\nChris Thomas discovered that XUL popups can be abused for spoofing or\n phishing attacks.\n\n\nFixes for the oldstable distribution (sarge) are not available. While there\nwill be another round of security updates for Mozilla products, Debian doesn't\nhave the resources to backport further security fixes to the old Mozilla\nproducts. You're strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable as soon as possible.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version\n1.0.9-0etch1. A build for the arm architecture is not yet available, it will\nbe provided later.\n\n\nThe unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.\n\n\n",
