	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X Window System,\nwhich may lead to privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-1003](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1003)\nSean Larsson discovered an integer overflow in the XC-MISC extension,\n which might lead to denial of service or local privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2007-1351](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1351)\nGreg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the font handling,\n which might lead to denial of service or local privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2007-1352](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1352)\nGreg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the font handling,\n which might lead to denial of service or local privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2007-1667](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1667)\nSami Leides discovered an integer overflow in the libx11 library\n which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n This update introduces tighter sanity checking of input passed to\n XCreateImage(). To cope with this an updated rdesktop package is\n delivered along with this security update. Another application\n reported to break is the proprietary Opera browser, which isn't\n part of Debian. The vendor has released updated packages, though.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.3.0.dfsg.1-14sarge4. This update lacks builds for the Sparc\narchitecture, due to problems on the build host. Packages will be released\nonce this problem has been resolved.\n\n\nThe stable distribution (etch) isn't affected by these problems, as the\nvulnerabilities have already been fixed during the Etch preparation\nfreeze phase.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your XFree86 packages.\n\n\n",
