	"details": "\nSeveral issues have been identified in Samba, the SMB/CIFS\nfile- and print-server implementation for GNU/Linux.\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-2444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2444)\nWhen translating SIDs to/from names using Samba local list of user and\n group accounts, a logic error in the smbd daemon's internal security\n stack may result in a transition to the root user id rather than the\n non-root user. The user is then able to temporarily issue SMB/CIFS\n protocol operations as the root user. This window of opportunity may\n allow the attacker to establish addition means of gaining root access to\n the server.\n* [CVE-2007-2446](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2446)\nVarious bugs in Samba's NDR parsing can allow a user to send specially\n crafted MS-RPC requests that will overwrite the heap space with user\n defined data.\n* [CVE-2007-2447](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2447)\nUnescaped user input parameters are passed as arguments to /bin/sh\n allowing for remote command execution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.0.24-6etch1.\n\n\nFor the testing and unstable distributions (lenny and sid,\nrespectively), these problems have been fixed in version 3.0.25-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your samba package.\n\n\n",
