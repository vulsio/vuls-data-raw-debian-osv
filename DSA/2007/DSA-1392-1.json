	"summary": "xulrunner - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a\nruntime environment for XUL applications. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-1095](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1095)\nMichal Zalewski discovered that the unload event handler had access to\n the address of the next page to be loaded, which could allow information\n disclosure or spoofing.\n* [CVE-2007-2292](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2292)\nStefano Di Paola discovered that insufficient validation of user names\n used in Digest authentication on a web site allows HTTP response splitting\n attacks.\n* [CVE-2007-3511](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3511)\nIt was discovered that insecure focus handling of the file upload\n control can lead to information disclosure. This is a variant of\n [CVE-2006-2894](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2894).\n* [CVE-2007-5334](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5334)\nEli Friedman discovered that web pages written in Xul markup can hide the\n titlebar of windows, which can lead to spoofing attacks.\n* [CVE-2007-5337](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5337)\nGeorgi Guninski discovered the insecure handling of smb:// and sftp:// URI\n schemes may lead to information disclosure. This vulnerability is only\n exploitable if Gnome-VFS support is present on the system.\n* [CVE-2007-5338](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5338)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered that the protection scheme offered by XPCNativeWrappers\n could be bypassed, which might allow privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2007-5339](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5339)\nL. David Baron, Boris Zbarsky, Georgi Guninski, Paul Nickerson, Olli Pettay,\n Jesse Ruderman, Vladimir Sukhoy, Daniel Veditz, and Martijn Wargers discovered\n crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-5340](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5340)\nIgor Bukanov, Eli Friedman, and Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes in the\n JavaScript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain xulrunner.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version\n1.8.0.14~pre071019b-0etch1. Builds for hppa and mipsel will be provided later.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.\n\n\n",
