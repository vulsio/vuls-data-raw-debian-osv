The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-0906](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0906)\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow in the str\\_replace()\n function could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-0907](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0907)\nIt was discovered that a buffer underflow in the sapi\\_header\\_op()\n function could crash the PHP interpreter.\n* [CVE-2007-0908](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0908)\nStefan Esser discovered that a programming error in the wddx\n extension allows information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2007-0909](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0909)\nIt was discovered that a format string vulnerability in the\n odbc\\_result\\_all() functions allows the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-0910](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0910)\nIt was discovered that super-global variables could be overwritten\n with session data.\n* [CVE-2007-0988](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0988)\nStefan Esser discovered that the zend\\_hash\\_init() function could\n be tricked into an endless loop, allowing denial of service through\n resource consumption until a timeout is triggered.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4:4.3.10-19.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 6:4.4.4-9 of php4 and version 5.2.0-9 of php5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php4 packages.\n\n\n",
