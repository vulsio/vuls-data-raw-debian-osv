	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox.\n\n\nThis will be the last security update of Mozilla-based products for\nthe oldstable (sarge) distribution of Debian. We recommend to upgrade\nto stable (etch) as soon as possible.\n\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nvulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-1282](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1282)\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow in text/enhanced message\n parsing allows the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-0994](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0994)\nIt was discovered that a regression in the Javascript engine allows\n the execution of Javascript with elevated privileges.\n* [CVE-2007-0995](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0995)\nIt was discovered that incorrect parsing of invalid HTML characters\n allows the bypass of content filters.\n* [CVE-2007-0996](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0996)\nIt was discovered that insecure child frame handling allows cross-site\n scripting.\n* [CVE-2007-0981](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0981)\nIt was discovered that Firefox handles URI with a null byte in the\n hostname insecurely.\n* [CVE-2007-0008](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0008)\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the\n execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-0009](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0009)\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the\n execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-0775](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0775)\nIt was discovered that multiple programming errors in the layout engine\n allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-0778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0778)\nIt was discovered that the page cache calculates hashes in an insecure\n manner.\n* [CVE-2006-6077](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6077)\nIt was discovered that the password manager allows the disclosure of\n passwords.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.4-2sarge17. You should upgrade to etch as soon as possible.\n\n\nThe stable distribution (etch) isn't affected. These vulnerabilities have\nbeen fixed prior to the release of Debian etch.\n\n\nThe unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains mozilla-firefox. Iceweasel\nis already fixed.\n\n\n",
