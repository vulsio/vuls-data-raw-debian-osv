	"summary": "pcre3 - arbitrary code execution",
	"details": "\n\nTavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team has discovered several\nsecurity issues in PCRE, the Perl-Compatible Regular Expression library,\nwhich potentially allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by compiling\nspecially crafted regular expressions.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 7.0 of the PCRE library featured a major rewrite of the regular\nexpression compiler, and it was deemed infeasible to backport the\nsecurity fixes in version 7.3 to the versions in Debian's stable and\noldstable distributions (6.7 and 4.5, respectively). Therefore, this\nupdate is based on version 7.4 (which includes the security bug fixes of\nthe 7.3 version, plus several regression fixes), with special patches to\nimprove the compatibility with the older versions. As a result, extra\ncare is necessary when applying this update.\n\n\n\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-1659](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1659)\n\n Unmatched \\Q\\E sequences with orphan \\E codes can cause the compiled\n regex to become desynchronized, resulting in corrupt bytecode that may\n result in multiple exploitable conditions.\n* [CVE-2007-1660](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1660)\n\n Multiple forms of character classes had their sizes miscalculated on\n initial passes, resulting in too little memory being allocated.\n* [CVE-2007-1661](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1661)\n\n Multiple patterns of the form \\X?\\d or \\P{L}?\\d in non-UTF-8 mode\n could backtrack before the start of the string, possibly leaking\n information from the address space, or causing a crash by reading out\n of bounds.\n* [CVE-2007-1662](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1662)\n\n A number of routines can be fooled into reading past the end of a\n string looking for unmatched parentheses or brackets, resulting in a\n denial of service.\n* [CVE-2007-4766](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4766)\n\n Multiple integer overflows in the processing of escape sequences could\n result in heap overflows or out of bounds reads/writes.\n* [CVE-2007-4767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4767)\n\n Multiple infinite loops and heap overflows were discovered in the\n handling of \\P and \\P{x} sequences, where the length of these\n non-standard operations was mishandled.\n* [CVE-2007-4768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4768)\n\n Character classes containing a lone unicode sequence were incorrectly\n optimised, resulting in a heap overflow.\n\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.5+7.4-1.\n\n\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 6.7+7.4-2.\n\n\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.3-1.\n\n\n\n",
