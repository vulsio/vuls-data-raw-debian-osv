	"summary": "openoffice.org - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nA heap overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the TIFF parsing\ncode of the OpenOffice.org suite. The parser uses untrusted values\nfrom the TIFF file to calculate the number of bytes of memory to\nallocate. A specially crafted TIFF image could trigger an integer\noverflow and subsequently a buffer overflow that could cause the\nexecution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.3-9sarge8.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.0.4.dfsg.2-7etch2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.1-9.\n\n\nFor the experimental distribution this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.0~src680m224-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.\n\n\n",
