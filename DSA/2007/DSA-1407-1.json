	"details": "\n\nAlin Rad Pop discovered that the Common UNIX Printing System is\nvulnerable to an off-by-one buffer overflow in the code to process IPP\npackets, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\n\n\nThe cupsys version in the old stable distribution (sarge) is not\nvulnerable to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.7-4etch1. Updated packages for the arm architecture will be\nprovided later.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cupsys packages.\n\n\n\n",
