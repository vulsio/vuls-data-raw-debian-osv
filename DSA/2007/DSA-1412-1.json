The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-5162](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5162)\nIt was discovered that the Ruby HTTP(S) module performs insufficient\n validation of SSL certificates, which may lead to man-in-the-middle\n attacks.\n* [CVE-2007-5770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5770)\nIt was discovered that the Ruby modules for FTP, Telnet, IMAP, POP\n and SMTP perform insufficient validation of SSL certificates, which\n may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain ruby1.9 packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.0+20060609-1etch1. Updated packages for hppa and sparc will\nbe provided later.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9 packages.\n\n\n",
