	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Clam\nanti-virus toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-6335](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6335)\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow in the decompression code\n for MEW archives may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-6336](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6336)\nIt was discovered that on off-by-one in the MS-ZIP decompression\n code may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected by these problems.\nHowever, since the clamav version from Sarge cannot process all current\nClam malware signatures any longer, support for the ClamAV in Sarge is\nnow discontinued. We recommend to upgrade to the stable distribution\nor run a backport of the stable version.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.90.1-3etch8.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.\n\n\n",
