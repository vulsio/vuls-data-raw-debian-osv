	"details": "\nThis update fixes all currently known regressions introduced with\nthe previous two revisions of DSA-1409.\nThe original text is reproduced below:\n\n\n\n> \n> Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in samba,\n> a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix. The Common \n> Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n> \n> \n> * [CVE-2007-5398](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5398)\n> Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that nmbd did not properly\n>  check the length of netbios packets. When samba is configured as a WINS\n>  server, a remote attacker could send multiple crafted requests resulting\n>  in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.\n> * [CVE-2007-4572](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4572)\n> Samba developers discovered that nmbd could be made to overrun a buffer\n>  during the processing of GETDC logon server requests. When samba is\n>  configured as a Primary or Backup Domain Controller, a remote attacker\n>  could send malicious logon requests and possibly cause a denial of\n>  service.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.0.14a-3sarge10.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.0.24-6etch8.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.0.27-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.\n\n\n",
