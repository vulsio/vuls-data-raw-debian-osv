	"details": "\nSeveral local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel\nthat may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary\ncode. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-6058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6058)\nLMH reported an issue in the minix filesystem that allows local users\n with mount privileges to create a DoS (printk flood) by mounting a\n specially crafted corrupt filesystem.\n* [CVE-2007-5966](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5966)\nWarren Togami discovered an issue in the hrtimer subsystem that allows\n a local user to cause a DoS (soft lockup) by requesting a timer sleep\n for a long period of time leading to an integer overflow.\n* [CVE-2007-6063](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6063)\nVenustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl\n handling, exploitable by a local user.\n* [CVE-2007-6206](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6206)\nBlake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user\n exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file\n retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to\n gain access to sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2007-6417](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6417)\nHugh Dickins discovered an issue in the tmpfs filesystem where, under\n a rare circumstance, a kernel page may be improperly cleared, leaking\n sensitive kernel memory to userspace or resulting in a DoS (crash).\n\n\nThese problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version \n2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch6.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 4.0 (etch) |\n| --- | --- |\n| fai-kernels | 1.17+etch.13etch6 |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.18-1um-2etch.13etch6 |\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot\nthe machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source\npackage, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.\n\n\n",
