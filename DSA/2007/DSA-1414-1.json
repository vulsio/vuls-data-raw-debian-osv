	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark\nnetwork traffic analyzer, which may lead to denial of service or \nexecution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-6114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6114)\nStefan Esser discovered a buffer overflow in the SSL dissector.\n Fabiodds discovered a buffer overflow in the iSeries trace\n dissector.\n* [CVE-2007-6117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6117)\nA programming error was discovered in the HTTP dissector, which may\n lead to denial of service.\n* [CVE-2007-6118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6118)\nThe MEGACO dissector could be tricked into resource exhaustion.\n* [CVE-2007-6120](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6120)\nThe Bluetooth SDP dissector could be tricked into an endless loop.\n* [CVE-2007-6121](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6121)\nThe RPC portmap dissector could be tricked into dereferencing\n a NULL pointer.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been\nfixed in version 0.10.10-2sarge10. (In Sarge Wireshark used to be\ncalled Ethereal). Updated packages for sparc and m68k will be provided\nlater.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.99.4-5.etch.1. Updated packages for sparc will be provided\nlater.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wireshark/ethereal packages.\n\n\n",
