	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, a\nserver-side, HTML-embedded scripting language, which may lead to the\nexecution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-1286](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1286)\nStefan Esser discovered an overflow in the object reference handling\n code of the unserialize() function, which allows the execution of\n arbitrary code if malformed input is passed from an application.\n* [CVE-2007-1375](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1375)\nStefan Esser discovered that an integer overflow in the substr\\_compare()\n function allows information disclosure of heap memory.\n* [CVE-2007-1376](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1376)\nStefan Esser discovered that insufficient validation of shared memory\n functions allows the disclosure of heap memory.\n* [CVE-2007-1380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1380)\nStefan Esser discovered that the session handler performs\n insufficient validation of variable name length values, which allows\n information disclosure through a heap information leak.\n* [CVE-2007-1453](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1453)\nStefan Esser discovered that the filtering framework performs insufficient\n input validation, which allows the execution of arbitrary code through a\n buffer underflow.\n* [CVE-2007-1454](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1454)\nStefan Esser discovered that the filtering framework can be bypassed \n with a special whitespace character.\n* [CVE-2007-1521](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1521)\nStefan Esser discovered a double free vulnerability in the\n session\\_regenerate\\_id() function, which allows the execution of\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-1583](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1583)\nStefan Esser discovered that a programming error in the mb\\_parse\\_str()\n function allows the activation of register\\_globals.\n* [CVE-2007-1700](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1700)\nStefan Esser discovered that the session extension incorrectly maintains\n the reference count of session variables, which allows the execution of\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-1711](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1711)\nStefan Esser discovered a double free vulnerability in the session\n management code, which allows the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-1718](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1718)\nStefan Esser discovered that the mail() function performs\n insufficient validation of folded mail headers, which allows mail\n header injection.\n* [CVE-2007-1777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1777)\nStefan Esser discovered that the extension to handle ZIP archives\n performs insufficient length checks, which allows the execution of\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-1824](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1824)\nStefan Esser discovered an off-by-one error in the filtering framework, which\n allows the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-1887](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1887)\nStefan Esser discovered that a buffer overflow in the sqlite extension\n allows the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-1889](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1889)\nStefan Esser discovered that the PHP memory manager performs an\n incorrect type cast, which allows the execution of arbitrary code\n through buffer overflows.\n* [CVE-2007-1900](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1900)\nStefan Esser discovered that incorrect validation in the email filter\n extension allows the injection of mail headers.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include php5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed\nin version 5.2.0-8+etch3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.2.0-11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages. Packages for the arm,\nhppa, mips and mipsel architectures are not yet available. They will be\nprovided later.\n\n\n",
