	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MIT reference\nimplementation of the Kerberos network authentication protocol suite,\nwhich may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common \nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-0956](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0956)\nIt was discovered that the krb5 telnet daemon performs insufficient\n validation of usernames, which might allow unauthorized logins or\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2007-0957](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0957)\niDefense discovered that a buffer overflow in the logging code of the\n KDC and the administration daemon might lead to arbitrary code\n execution.\n* [CVE-2007-1216](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1216)\nIt was discovered that a double free in the RPCSEC\\_GSS part of the \n GSS library code might lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.6-2sarge4.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.4.4-7etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Kerberos packages.\n\n\n",
