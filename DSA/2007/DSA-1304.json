This defect\n can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (Oops).\n\n\nThe following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture\nfix the problems mentioned above:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 3.1 (sarge) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Source | 2.6.8-16sarge7 |\n| Alpha architecture | 2.6.8-16sarge7 |\n| AMD64 architecture | 2.6.8-16sarge7 |\n| HP Precision architecture | 2.6.8-6sarge7 |\n| Intel IA-32 architecture | 2.6.8-16sarge7 |\n| Intel IA-64 architecture | 2.6.8-14sarge7 |\n| Motorola 680x0 architecture | 2.6.8-4sarge7 |\n| PowerPC architecture | 2.6.8-12sarge7 |\n| IBM S/390 architecture | 2.6.8-5sarge7 |\n| Sun Sparc architecture | 2.6.8-15sarge7 |\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot\nthe machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source\npackage, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.\n\n\n",
