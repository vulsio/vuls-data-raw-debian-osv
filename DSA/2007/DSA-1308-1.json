	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel web\nbrowser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common \nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-1362](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1362)\nNicolas Derouet discovered that Iceweasel performs insufficient \n validation of cookies, which could lead to denial of service.\n* [CVE-2007-2867](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2867)\nBoris Zbarsky, Eli Friedman, Georgi Guninski, Jesse Ruderman, Martijn\n Wargers and Olli Pettay discovered crashes in the layout engine, which\n might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-2868](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2868)\nBrendan Eich, Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman, moz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 and Wladimir Palant\n discovered crashes in the javascript engine, which might allow the execution of\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-2869](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2869)\nMarcel discovered that malicious web sites can cause massive\n resource consumption through the auto completion feature, resulting\n in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2007-2870](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2870)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered that adding an event listener through the\n `addEventListener()` function allows cross-site scripting.\n* [CVE-2007-2871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2871)\nChris Thomas discovered that XUL popups can be abused for spoofing or\n phishing attacks.\n\n\nFixes for the oldstable distribution (sarge) are not available. While there\nwill be another round of security updates for Mozilla products, Debian doesn't\nhave the resources to backport further security fixes to the old Mozilla\nproducts. You're strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable as soon as possible.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version\n2.0.0.4-0etch1. A build for the Alpha architecture is not yet available, it will\nbe provided later.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version\n2.0.0.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.\n\n\n",
