The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-2509](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2509)\nIt was discovered that missing input sanitising inside the ftp\n extension permits an attacker to execute arbitrary FTP commands.\n This requires the attacker to already have access to the FTP\n server.\n* [CVE-2007-2510](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2510)\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow in the SOAP extension permits\n the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include php5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed\nin version 5.2.0-8+etch4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.2.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages. Packages for the Sparc\narchitectures are not yet available, due to problems on the build host. They\nwill be provided later.\n\n\n",
