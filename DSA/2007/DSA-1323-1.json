The Common \nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-2442](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2442)\nWei Wang discovered that the free of an uninitialised pointer in the\n Kerberos RPC library may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-2443](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2443)\nWei Wang discovered that insufficient input sanitising in the\n Kerberos RPC library may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-2798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2798)\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow in the Kerberos\n administration daemon may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.6-2sarge5. Packages for hppa, mips and powerpc are not yet\navailable. They will be provided later.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.4-7etch2. Packages for hppa and mips are not yet available.\nThey will be provided later.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.dfsg.1-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Kerberos packages.\n\n\n",
