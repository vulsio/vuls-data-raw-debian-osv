	],
	"summary": "openafs - design error",
	"details": "\nA design error has been identified in the OpenAFS, a cross-platform\ndistributed filesystem included with Debian.\n\n\nOpenAFS historically has enabled setuid filesystem support for the local\ncell. However, with its existing protocol, OpenAFS can only use\nencryption, and therefore integrity protection, if the user is\nauthenticated. Unauthenticated access doesn't do integrity protection.\nThe practical result is that it's possible for an attacker with\nknowledge of AFS to forge an AFS FetchStatus call and make an arbitrary\nbinary file appear to an AFS client host to be setuid. If they can then\narrange for that binary to be executed, they will be able to achieve\nprivilege escalation.\n\n\nOpenAFS 1.3.81-3sarge2 changes the default behavior to disable setuid\nfiles globally, including the local cell. It is important to note that\nthis change will not take effect until the AFS kernel module, built from\nthe openafs-modules-source package, is rebuilt and loaded into your\nkernel. As a temporary workaround until the kernel module can be\nreloaded, setuid support can be manually disabled for the local cell by\nrunning the following command as root\n\n\n`fs setcell -cell <localcell> -nosuid`\n\n\nFollowing the application of this update, if you are certain there is\nno security risk of an attacker forging AFS fileserver responses, you\ncan re-enable setuid status selectively with the following command,\nhowever this should not be done on sites that are visible to the\nInternet\n\n\n`fs setcell -cell <localcell> -suid`\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.81-3sarge2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable\ndistribution (etch), this problem will be fixed in version 1.4.2-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openafs package.\n\n\n",
