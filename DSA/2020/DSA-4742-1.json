	"details": "\nTim Starling discovered two vulnerabilities in firejail, a sandbox\nprogram to restrict the running environment of untrusted applications.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-17367](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17367)\nIt was reported that firejail does not respect the end-of-options\n separator (\"--\"), allowing an attacker with control over the command\n line options of the sandboxed application, to write data to a\n specified file.\n* [CVE-2020-17368](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17368)\nIt was reported that firejail when redirecting output via --output\n or --output-stderr, concatenates all command line arguments into a\n single string that is passed to a shell. An attacker who has control\n over the command line arguments of the sandboxed application could\n take advantage of this flaw to run arbitrary commands.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.9.58.2-2+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your firejail packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of firejail please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/firejail>\n\n\n",
