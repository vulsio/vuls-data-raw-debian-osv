	"details": "\nAshley Newson discovered that the XRDP sessions manager was susceptible\nto denial of service. A local attacker can further take advantage of\nthis flaw to impersonate the XRDP sessions manager and capture any user\ncredentials that are submitted to XRDP, approve or reject arbitrary\nlogin credentials or to hijack existing sessions for xorgxrdp sessions.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.9-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xrdp packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of xrdp please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xrdp](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xrdp)\n\n\n",
