	"summary": "roundcube - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that roundcube, a skinnable AJAX based webmail\nsolution for IMAP servers, did not correctly process and sanitize\nrequests. This would allow a remote attacker to perform either a\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) forcing an authenticated user to be\nlogged out, or a Cross-Side Scripting (XSS) leading to execution of\narbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.2.3+dfsg.1-4+deb9u4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.11+dfsg.1-1~deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of roundcube please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/roundcube](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/roundcube)\n\n\n",
