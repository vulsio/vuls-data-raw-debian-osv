	"details": "\nMultiple issues have been found in cacti, a server monitoring system,\npotentially resulting in SQL code execution or information disclosure by\nauthenticated users.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-16723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16723)\nAuthenticated users may bypass authorization checks for viewing a graph\n by submitting requests with modified local\\_graph\\_id parameters.\n* [CVE-2019-17357](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17357)\nThe graph administration interface insufficiently sanitizes the\n template\\_id parameter, potentially resulting in SQL injection. This\n vulnerability might be leveraged by authenticated attackers to perform\n unauthorized SQL code execution on the database.\n* [CVE-2019-17358](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17358)\nThe sanitize\\_unserialize\\_selected\\_items function (lib/functions.php)\n insufficiently sanitizes user input before deserializing it,\n potentially resulting in unsafe deserialization of user-controlled\n data. This vulnerability might be leveraged by authenticated attackers\n to influence the program control flow or cause memory corruption.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.8.8h+ds1-10+deb9u1. Note that stretch was only affected by\n[CVE-2018-17358](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17358).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.2+ds1-2+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of cacti please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cacti](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cacti)\n\n\n",
