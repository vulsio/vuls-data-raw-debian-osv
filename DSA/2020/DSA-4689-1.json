	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server\nimplementation.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-6477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6477)\nIt was discovered that TCP-pipelined queries can bypass tcp-client\n limits resulting in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2020-8616](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8616)\nIt was discovered that BIND does not sufficiently limit the number\n of fetches performed when processing referrals. An attacker can take\n advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (performance\n degradation) or use the recursing server in a reflection attack with\n a high amplification factor.\n* [CVE-2020-8617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8617)\nIt was discovered that a logic error in the code which checks TSIG\n validity can be used to trigger an assertion failure, resulting in\n denial of service.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.3+deb9u6.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of bind9 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bind9](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bind9)\n\n\n",
