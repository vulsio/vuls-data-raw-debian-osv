	"summary": "gnutls28 - security update",
	"details": "\nA flaw was reported in the TLS session ticket key construction in\nGnuTLS, a library implementing the TLS and SSL protocols. The flaw\ncaused the TLS server to not securely construct a session ticket\nencryption key considering the application supplied secret, allowing a\nman-in-the-middle attacker to bypass authentication in TLS 1.3 and\nrecover previous conversations in TLS 1.2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.6.7-4+deb10u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of gnutls28 please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/gnutls28>\n\n\n",
