	],
	"summary": "bluez - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was reported that the BlueZ's HID and HOGP profile implementations\ndon't specifically require bonding between the device and the host.\nMalicious devices can take advantage of this flaw to connect to a target\nhost and impersonate an existing HID device without security or to cause\nan SDP or GATT service discovery to take place which would allow HID\nreports to be injected to the input subsystem from a non-bonded source.\n\n\nFor the HID profile an new configuration option (ClassicBondedOnly) is\nintroduced to make sure that input connections only come from bonded\ndevice connections. The options defaults to false to maximize device\ncompatibility.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed\nin version 5.43-2+deb9u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.50-1.2~deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bluez packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of bluez please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bluez](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bluez)\n\n\n",
