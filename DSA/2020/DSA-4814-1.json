	"details": "\nIt was discovered that xerces-c, a validating XML parser library for\nC++, did not correctly scan DTDs. The use-after-free vulnerability\nresulting from this issue would allow a remote attacker to leverage a\nspecially crafted XML file in order to crash the application or\npotentially execute arbitrary code.\nPlease note that the patch fixing this issue comes at the expense of a\nnewly introduced memory leak.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.2.2+debian-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xerces-c packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of xerces-c please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xerces-c](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xerces-c)\n\n\n",
