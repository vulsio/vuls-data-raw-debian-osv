	"details": "\nKen Gaillot discovered a vulnerability in the Pacemaker cluster\nresource manager: If ACLs were configured for users in the haclient\ngroup, the ACL restrictions could be bypassed via unrestricted IPC\ncommunication, resulting in cluster-wide arbitrary code execution with\nroot privileges.\n\n\nIf the enable-acl cluster option isn't enabled, members of the\nhaclient group can modify Pacemaker's Cluster Information Base without\nrestriction, which already gives them these capabilities, so there is\nno additional exposure in such a setup.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.0.1-5+deb10u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pacemaker packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of pacemaker please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pacemaker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pacemaker)\n\n\n",
