	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the Tomcat servlet and JSP\nengine, which could result in HTTP request smuggling, code execution\nin the AJP connector (disabled by default in Debian) or a man-in-the-middle\nattack against the JMX interface.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 9.0.31-1~deb10u1. The fix for [\\\nCVE-2020-1938](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1938) may require\nconfiguration changes when Tomcat is used with the AJP connector, e.g.\nin combination with libapache-mod-jk. For instance the attribute\nsecretRequired is set to true by default now. For affected setups it's\nrecommended to review [\\\nhttps://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/ajp.html](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/ajp.html)\nbefore the deploying the update.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat9 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of tomcat9 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tomcat9](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tomcat9)\n\n\n",
