	"details": "\nA flaw was reported in the DTLS protocol implementation in GnuTLS, a\nlibrary implementing the TLS and SSL protocols. The DTLS client would\nnot contribute any randomness to the DTLS negotiation, breaking the\nsecurity guarantees of the DTLS protocol.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.6.7-4+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of gnutls28 please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/gnutls28>\n\n\n",
