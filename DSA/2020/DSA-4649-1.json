	"details": "\nFelix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered that HAProxy, a TCP/HTTP\nreverse proxy, did not properly handle HTTP/2 headers. This would allow\nan attacker to write arbitrary bytes around a certain location on the\nheap, resulting in denial-of-service or potential arbitrary code\nexecution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8.19-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of haproxy please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy)\n\n\n",
