An attacker able to present SM2 content for\n decryption to an application can take advantage of this flaw to\n change application behaviour or cause the application to crash\n (denial of service).\n* [CVE-2021-3712](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3712)\nIngo Schwarze reported a buffer overrun flaw when processing ASN.1\n strings in the X509\\_aux\\_print() function, which can result in denial\n of service.\n\n\nAdditional details can be found in the upstream advisory:\n<https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210824.txt>\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.1.1d-0+deb10u7.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1.1k-1+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openssl please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssl>\n\n\n",
