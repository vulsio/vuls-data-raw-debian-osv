An\n attacker within radio range of the device running P2P could take\n advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially\n execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2021-27803](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-27803)\nIt was discovered that wpa\\_supplicant does not properly process\n P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) provision discovery requests. An attacker\n within radio range of the device running P2P could take advantage\n of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially execute\n arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2:2.7+git20190128+0c1e29f-6+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of wpa please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wpa>\n\n\n",
