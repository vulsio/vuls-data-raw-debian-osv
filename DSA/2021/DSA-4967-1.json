An attacker can take\nadvantage of this flaw for writing to arbitrary files to the filesystem\nif a malformed Squashfs image is processed.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1:4.3-12+deb10u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:4.4-2+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squashfs-tools packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of squashfs-tools please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squashfs-tools>\n\n\n",
