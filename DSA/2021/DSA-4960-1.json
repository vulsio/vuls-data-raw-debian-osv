	"summary": "haproxy - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in HAProxy, a fast and reliable\nload balancing reverse proxy, which can result in HTTP request\nsmuggling. By carefully crafting HTTP/2 requests, it is possible to\nsmuggle another HTTP request to the backend selected by the HTTP/2\nrequest. With certain configurations, it allows an attacker to send an\nHTTP request to a backend, circumventing the backend selection logic.\n\n\nKnown workarounds are to disable HTTP/2 and set\n\"tune.h2.max-concurrent-streams\" to 0 in the global section.\n\n\nglobal\n tune.h2.max-concurrent-streams 0\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.9-2+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of haproxy please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy>\n\n\n",
