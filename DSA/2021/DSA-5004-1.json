	"summary": "libxstream-java - security update",
	"details": "\nMultiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in XStream, a Java\nlibrary to serialize objects to XML and back again.\n\n\nThese vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary\ncode from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream.\n\n\nXStream itself sets up a whitelist by default now, i.e. it blocks all classes\nexcept those types it has explicit converters for. It used to have a blacklist\nby default, i.e. it tried to block all currently known critical classes of the\nJava runtime. Main reason for the blacklist were compatibility, it allowed to\nuse newer versions of XStream as drop-in replacement. However, this approach\nhas failed. A growing list of security reports has proven, that a blacklist is\ninherently unsafe, apart from the fact that types of 3rd libraries were not\neven considered. A blacklist scenario should be avoided in general, because it\nprovides a false sense of security.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.4.11.1-1+deb10u3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.15-3+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxstream-java packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libxstream-java please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxstream-java](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxstream-java)\n\n\n",
