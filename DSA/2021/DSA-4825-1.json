This flaw was introduced by\n earlier changes addressing\n [\\\n CVE-2020-12100](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12100).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:2.3.4.1-5+deb10u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of dovecot please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dovecot](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dovecot)\n\n\n",
