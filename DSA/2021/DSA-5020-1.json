	"details": "\nChen Zhaojun of Alibaba Cloud Security Team discovered a critical security\nvulnerability in Apache Log4j, a popular Logging Framework for Java. JNDI\nfeatures used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect\nagainst attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker\nwho can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary\ncode loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From\nversion 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.\n\n\nThis update also fixes [\\\nCVE-2020-9488](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9488) in the oldstable distribution (buster). Improper validation\nof certificate with host mismatch in Apache Log4j SMTP appender. This could\nallow an SMTPS connection to be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack\nwhich could leak any log messages sent through that appender.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed\nin version 2.15.0-1~deb10u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.15.0-1~deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache-log4j2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache-log4j2 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache-log4j2](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache-log4j2)\n\n\n",
