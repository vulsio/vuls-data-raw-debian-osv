	"details": "\nIt was discovered that the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in krb5, the\nMIT implementation of Kerberos, is prone to a NULL pointer dereference\nflaw. An unauthenticated attacker can take advantage of this flaw to\ncause a denial of service (KDC crash) by sending a request containing a\nPA-ENCRYPTED-CHALLENGE padata element without using FAST.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.17-3+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of krb5 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/krb5](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/krb5)\n\n\n",
