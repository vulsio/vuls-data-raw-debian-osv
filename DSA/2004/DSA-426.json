	"summary": "netpbm-free - insecure temporary files",
	"details": "\nnetpbm is a graphics conversion toolkit made up of a large number of\nsingle-purpose programs. Many of these programs were found to create\ntemporary files in an insecure manner, which could allow a local\nattacker to overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking a\nvulnerable netpbm tool.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been\nfixed in version 2:9.20-8.4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2:9.25-9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your netpbm-free package.\n\n\n",
