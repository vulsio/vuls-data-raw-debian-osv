	"details": "\nAn information leak has been detected in CUPS, the Common UNIX\nPrinting System, which may lead to the disclosure of sensitive\ninformation, such as user names and passwords which are written into\nlog files.\n\n\nThe used patch only eliminates the authentication information in the\ndevice URI which is logged in the error\\_log file. It does not\neliminate the URI from the environment and process table, which is why\nthe CUPS developers recommend that system administrators do not code\nauthentication information in device URIs in the first place.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.14-5woody7.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.20final+rc1-9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your CUPS package.\n\n\n",
