	"summary": "kdelibs - cookie path traversal",
	"details": "\nA vulnerability was discovered in KDE where the path restrictions on\ncookies could be bypassed using encoded relative path components\n(e.g., \"/../\"). This means that a cookie which should only be sent by\nthe browser to an application running at /app1, the browser could\ninadvertently include it with a request sent to /app2 on the same\nserver.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in kdelibs version 4:2.2.2-6woody3 and kdelibs-crypto version\n4:2.2.2-13.woody.9.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem was fixed in kdelibs\nversion 4:3.1.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your kdelibs and kdelibs-crypto packages.\n\n\n",
