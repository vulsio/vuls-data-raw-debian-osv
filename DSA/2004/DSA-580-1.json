	"summary": "iptables - missing initialisation",
	"details": "\nFaheem Mitha noticed that the iptables command, an administration tool\nfor IPv4 packet filtering and NAT, did not always load the required\nmodules on its own as it was supposed to. This could lead to firewall\nrules not being loaded on system startup. This caused a failure in\nconnection with rules provided by lokkit at least.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.6a-5.0woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.11-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your iptables package.\n\n\n",
