	"details": "\nMarcus Meissner from SUSE has discovered several buffer overflows in\nthe ImageMagick graphics library. An attacker could create a\nmalicious image or video file in AVI, BMP, or DIB format that could\ncrash the reading process. It might be possible that carefully\ncrafted images could also allow to execute arbitrary code with the\ncapabilities of the invoking process.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.4.4.5-1woody3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.0.6.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.\n\n\n",
