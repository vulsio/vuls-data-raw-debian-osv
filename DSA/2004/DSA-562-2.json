The following problems have been identified\nby the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0835](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0835)\nOleksandr Byelkin noticed that ALTER TABLE ... RENAME checks\n CREATE/INSERT rights of the old table instead of the new one.\n* [CAN-2004-0836](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0836)\nLukasz Wojtow noticed a buffer overrun in the mysql\\_real\\_connect\n function.\n* [CAN-2004-0837](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0837)\nDean Ellis noticed that multiple threads ALTERing the same (or\n different) MERGE tables to change the UNION can cause the server\n to crash or stall.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.23.49-8.8.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.0.21-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql and related packages and\nrestart services linking against them (e.g. Apache/PHP).\n\n\n",
