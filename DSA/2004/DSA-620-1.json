The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0452](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0452)\nJeroen van Wolffelaar discovered that the rmtree() function in the\n File::Path module removes directory trees in an insecure manner\n which could lead to the removal of arbitrary files and directories\n through a symlink attack.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0976](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0976)\nTrustix developers discovered several insecure uses of temporary\n files in many modules which allow a local attacker to overwrite\n files via a symlink attack.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.6.1-8.8.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.8.4-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.\n\n\n",
