	"summary": "fte - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSteve Kemp and Jaguar discovered a number of buffer overflow\nvulnerabilities in vfte, a version of the fte editor which runs on the\nLinux console, found in the package fte-console. This program is\nsetuid root in order to perform certain types of low-level operations\non the console.\n\n\nDue to these bugs, setuid privilege has been removed from vfte, making\nit only usable by root. We recommend using the terminal version (in\nthe fte-terminal package) instead, which runs on any capable terminal\nincluding the Linux console.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.49.13-15woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.50.0-1.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your fte package.\n\n\n",
