	"summary": "iproute - denial of service",
	"details": "\nHerbert Xu reported that local users could cause a denial of service\nagainst iproute, a set of tools for controlling networking in Linux\nkernels. iproute uses the netlink interface to communicate with the\nkernel, but failed to verify that the messages it received came from\nthe kernel (rather than from other user processes).\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 20010824-8woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your iproute package.\n\n\n",
