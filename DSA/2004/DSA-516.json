Other parts of postgresql are not affected.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.2.1-2woody5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 07.03.0200-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your postgresql and related package.\n\n\n",
