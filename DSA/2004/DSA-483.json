	"summary": "mysql - insecure temporary file creation",
	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities have been discovered in mysql, a common database\nsystem. Two scripts contained in the package don't create temporary\nfiles in a secure fashion. This could allow a local attacker to\noverwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking the MySQL\nserver, which is often the root user. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0381](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0381)\nThe script mysqlbug in MySQL allows local users to overwrite\n arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0388](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0388)\nThe script mysqld\\_multi in MySQL allows local users to overwrite\n arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.23.49-8.6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed in\nversion 4.0.18-6 of mysql-dfsg.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql, mysql-dfsg and related\npackages.\n\n\n",
