	"summary": "apache - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nGeorgi Guninski discovered a buffer overflow bug in Apache's mod\\_proxy\nmodule, whereby a remote user could potentially cause arbitrary code\nto be executed with the privileges of an Apache httpd child process\n(by default, user www-data). Note that this bug is only exploitable\nif the mod\\_proxy module is in use.\n\n\nNote that this bug exists in a module in the apache-common package,\nshared by apache, apache-ssl and apache-perl, so this update is\nsufficient to correct the bug for all three builds of Apache httpd.\nHowever, on systems using apache-ssl or apache-perl, httpd will not\nautomatically be restarted.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.3.26-0woody5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.31-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your apache package.\n\n\n",
