	"details": "\nEvgeny Demidov discovered a potential buffer overflow in a Kerberos 4\ncomponent of heimdal, a free implementation of Kerberos 5. The\nproblem is present in kadmind, a server for administrative access to\nthe Kerberos database. This problem could perhaps be exploited to\ncause the daemon to read a negative amount of data which could lead to\nunexpected behaviour.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.4e-7.woody.9.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.6.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your heimdal and related packages.\n\n\n",
