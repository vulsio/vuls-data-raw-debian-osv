While\ninvestigating this vulnerability, a buffer overflow was also\ndiscovered in related code. By exploiting one of these\nvulnerabilities, a local or remote user could potentially cause\narbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of 1) the rlprd\nprocess (remote), or 2) root (local).\n\n\n[\\\nCAN-2004-0393](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0393): format string vulnerability via syslog(3) in msg()\nfunction in rlpr\n\n\n[\\\nCAN-2004-0454](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0454): buffer overflow in msg() function in rlpr\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been\nfixed in version 2.02-7woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your rlpr package.\n\n\n",
