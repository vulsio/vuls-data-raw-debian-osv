	"summary": "openssl - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in openssl, an implementation of\nthe SSL protocol, using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool. More\ninformation can be found in the following [NISCC\nVulnerability Advisory](http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/224012/index.htm) and this [OpenSSL\nadvisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20040317.txt). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentified the following vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0079](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0079)\nNull-pointer assignment in the\n do\\_change\\_cipher\\_spec() function. A remote attacker could perform\n a carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server that used\n the OpenSSL library in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash.\n Depending on the application this could lead to a denial of\n service.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0081](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0081)\nA bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 that\n can lead to a Denial of Service attack (infinite loop).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nopenssl version 0.9.6c-2.woody.6, openssl094 version 0.9.4-6.woody.4\nand openssl095 version 0.9.5a-6.woody.5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your openssl package.\n\n\n",
