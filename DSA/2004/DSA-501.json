	"details": "\nGeorgi Guninski discovered two stack-based buffer overflows. They can\nnot be exploited with the default configuration from the Debian\nsystem, though. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems that are fixed with this update:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0399](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0399)\nWhen \"sender\\_verify = true\" is configured in exim.conf a buffer\n overflow can happen during verification of the sender. This\n problem is fixed in exim 4.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0400](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0400)\nWhen headers\\_check\\_syntax is configured in exim.conf a buffer\n overflow can happen during the header check. This problem does\n also exist in exim 4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.35-1woody3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.36-11 for exim 3 and in version 4.33-1 for exim 4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your exim package.\n\n\n",
