	"summary": "emil - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nUlf HĂ¤rnhammar discovered a number of vulnerabilities in emil, a\nfilter for converting Internet mail messages. The vulnerabilities\nfall into two categories:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0152](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0152)\nBuffer overflows in (1) the encode\\_mime function,\n (2) the encode\\_uuencode function, (3) the decode\\_uuencode\n function. These bugs could allow a carefully crafted email message\n to cause the execution of arbitrary code supplied with the message\n when it is acted upon by emil.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0153](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0153)\nFormat string bugs in statements which print\n various error messages. The exploit potential of these bugs has\n not been established, and is probably configuration-dependent.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.1.0-beta9-11woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your emil package.\n\n\n",
