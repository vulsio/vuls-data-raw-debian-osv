	"details": "\nUlf HĂ¤rnhammar discovered two format string bugs ([CAN-2004-0104](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0104)) and\ntwo buffer overflow bugs ([CAN-2004-0105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0105)) in metamail, an\nimplementation of MIME. An attacker could create a carefully-crafted\nmail message which will execute arbitrary code as the victim when it\nis opened and parsed through metamail.\n\n\nWe have been devoting some effort to trying to avoid shipping metamail\nin the future. It became unmaintainable and these are probably not\nthe last of the vulnerabilities.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.7-45woody.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed in\nversion 2.7-45.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your metamail package.\n\n\n",
