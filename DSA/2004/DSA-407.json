	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered upstream in ethereal, a\nnetwork traffic analyzer. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2003-0925](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0925)\nA buffer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed GTP\n MSISDN string.\n\n* [CAN-2003-0926](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0926)\nVia certain malformed ISAKMP or MEGACO packets remote attackers are\n able to cause a denial of service (crash).\n\n* [CAN-2003-0927](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0927)\nA heap-based buffer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a\n denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via\n the SOCKS dissector.\n\n* [CAN-2003-1012](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-1012)\nThe SMB dissector allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service via a malformed SMB packet that triggers a segmentation\n fault during processing of selected packets.\n\n* [CAN-2003-1013](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-1013)\nThe Q.931 dissector allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service (crash) via a malformed Q.931, which triggers a null\n dereference.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.4-1woody6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.10.0-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ethereal and tethereal packages.\n\n\n",
