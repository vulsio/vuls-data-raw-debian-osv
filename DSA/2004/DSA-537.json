	"summary": "ruby - insecure file permissions",
	"details": "\nAndres Salomon noticed a problem in the CGI session management of\nRuby, an object-oriented scripting language. CGI::Session's FileStore\n(and presumably PStore, but not in Debian woody) implementations store\nsession information insecurely. They simply create files, ignoring\npermission issues. This can lead an attacker who has also shell\naccess to the webserver to take over a session.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.7-3woody3.\n\n\nFor the unstable and testing distributions (sid and sarge) this\nproblem has been fixed in version 1.8.1+1.8.2pre1-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libruby package.\n\n\n",
