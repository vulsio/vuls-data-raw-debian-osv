	"details": "\nDavid B Harris discovered a problem with mod-auth-shadow, an Apache\nmodule which authenticates users against the system shadow password\ndatabase, where the expiration status of the user's account and\npassword were not enforced. This vulnerability would allow an\notherwise authorized user to successfully authenticate, when the\nattempt should be rejected due to the expiration parameters.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.3-3.1woody.1\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your mod-auth-shadow package.\n\n\n",
