The program uses several environment variables as\ninputs but doesn't apply a size check before copying one of them into\na fixed size buffer.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.0beta23-2woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.0beta26-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your crawl package.\n\n\n",
