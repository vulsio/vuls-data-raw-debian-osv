	"details": "\nLudwig Nussel discovered a problem in webmin, a web-based\nadministration toolkit. A temporary directory was used but without\nchecking for the previous owner. This could allow an attacker to\ncreate the directory and place dangerous symbolic links inside.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.94-7woody3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.160-1 of webmin and 1.090-1 of usermin.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your webmin packages.\n\n\n",
