	"summary": "jitterbug - improperly sanitised input",
	"details": "\nSteve Kemp discovered a security related problem in jitterbug, a\nsimple CGI based bug tracking and reporting tool. Unfortunately the\nprogram executions do not properly sanitize input, which allows an\nattacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the bug\ndatabase. As mitigating factors these attacks are only available to\nnon-guest users, and accounts for these people must be setup by the\nadministrator making them \"trusted\".\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.2-4.2woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.2-4.5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jitterbug package.\n\n\n",
