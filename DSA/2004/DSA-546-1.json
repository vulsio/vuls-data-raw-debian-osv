	"details": "\nChris Evans discovered several problems in gdk-pixbuf, the GdkPixBuf\nlibrary used in Gtk. It is possible for an attacker to execute\narbitrary code on the victims machine. Gdk-pixbuf for Gtk+1.2 is an\nexternal package. For Gtk+2.0 it's part of the main gtk package.\n\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies the\nfollowing vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0753](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0753)\nDenial of service in bmp loader.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0782](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0782)\nHeap-based overflow in pixbuf\\_create\\_from\\_xpm.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0788](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0788)\nInteger overflow in the ico loader.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.17.0-2woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.22.0-7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gdk-pixbuf packages.\n\n\n",
