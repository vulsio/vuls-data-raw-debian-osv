In order for\nthis vulnerability to be exploited, mpg123 would need to request an\nmp3 stream from a malicious remote server via HTTP.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 0.59r-13woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.59r-15.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your mpg123 package.\n\n\n",
