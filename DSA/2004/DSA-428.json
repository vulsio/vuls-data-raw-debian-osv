	"summary": "slocate - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nA vulnerability was discovered in slocate, a program to index and\nsearch for files, whereby a specially crafted database could overflow\na heap-based buffer. This vulnerability could be exploited by a local\nattacker to gain the privileges of the \"slocate\" group, which can\naccess the global database containing a list of pathnames of all files\non the system, including those which should only be visible to\nprivileged users.\n\n\nThis problem, and a category of potential similar problems, have been\nfixed by modifying slocate to drop privileges before reading a\nuser-supplied database.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 2.6-1.3.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\nRefer to Debian bug [#226103](https://bugs.debian.org/226103) \nfor status information.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your slocate package.\n\n\n",
