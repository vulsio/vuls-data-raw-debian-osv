This could be exploited by an attacker to insert malicious\ncommands hidden for the user, who has to hit enter to continue, which\nwould also execute the hidden commands.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.2-0pre2002042903.3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.2-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your eterm package.\n\n\n",
