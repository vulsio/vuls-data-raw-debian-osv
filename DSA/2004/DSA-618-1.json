	"summary": "imlib - buffer overflows, integer overflows",
	"details": "\nPavel Kankovsky discovered that several overflows found in the libXpm\nlibrary were also present in imlib, an imaging library for X and X11.\nAn attacker could create a carefully crafted image file in such a way\nthat it could cause an application linked with imlib to execute\narbitrary code when the file was opened by a victim. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-1025](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1025)\nMultiple heap-based buffer overflows.\n\n* [CAN-2004-1026](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1026)\nMultiple integer overflows.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.14-2woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.14-17.1 of imlib and in version 1.9.14-16.1 of imlib+png2\nwhich produces the imlib1 package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your imlib packages immediately.\n\n\n",
