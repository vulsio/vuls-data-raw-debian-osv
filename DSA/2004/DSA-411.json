This\nvulnerability could be exploited by a remote attacker to overwrite\nmemory, and possibly execute arbitrary code. In order for this\nvulnerability to be exploited, mpg321 would need to play a malicious\nmp3 file (including via HTTP streaming).\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 0.2.10.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.2.10.3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your mpg321 package.\n\n\n",
