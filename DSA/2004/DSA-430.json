	"summary": "trr19 - missing privilege release",
	"details": "\nSteve Kemp discovered a problem in trr19, a type trainer application\nfor GNU Emacs, which is written as a pair of setgid() binaries and\nwrapper programs which execute commands for GNU Emacs. However, the\nbinaries don't drop privileges before executing a command, allowing an\nattacker to gain access to the local group games.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0beta5-15woody1. The mipsel binary will be added later.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your trr19 package.\n\n\n",
