	"details": "\nPaul Starzetz discovered a flaw in bounds checking in mremap() in the\nLinux kernel (present in version 2.4.x and 2.6.x) which may allow a\nlocal attacker to gain root privileges. Version 2.2 is not affected\nby this bug.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.17-0.020226.2.woody3 the mips and mipsel architectures.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon\nwith newly uploaded packages.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel packages. This problem has\nbeen fixed in the upstream version 2.4.24 as well.\n\n\n",
