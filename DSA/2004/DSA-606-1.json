Hence, a client\nprematurely terminating the TCP connection could also terminate the\nserver process.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0-2woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nfs-utils package.\n\n\n",
