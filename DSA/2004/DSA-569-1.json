	"details": "\nMichal Zalewski discovered a bug in the netkit-telnet server (telnetd)\nwhereby a remote attacker could cause the telnetd process to free an\ninvalid pointer. This causes the telnet server process to crash,\nleading to a straightforward denial of service (inetd will disable the\nservice if telnetd is crashed repeatedly), or possibly the execution\nof arbitrary code with the privileges of the telnetd process (by\ndefault, the 'telnetd' user).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.17.17+0.1-2woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.17.24+0.1-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your netkit-telnet-ssl package.\n\n\n",
