User input is copied into variables not large enough\nfor all cases. This can lead to an overflow of a static heap\nvariable.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.18.0-1woody3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.22.1-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cadaver package.\n\n\n",
