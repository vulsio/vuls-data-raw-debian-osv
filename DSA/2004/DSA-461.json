A local attacker could potentially\nexploit this vulnerability, given knowledge of a local user's password\nand the presence of at least one entry in /etc/calife.auth, to execute\narbitrary code with root privileges.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 2.8.4c-1woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.8.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your calife package.\n\n\n",
