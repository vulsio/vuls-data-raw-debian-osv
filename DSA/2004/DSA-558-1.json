When running in a threaded model,\nespecially with Apache 2, a segmentation fault can take out a whole\nprocess and hence create a denial of service for the whole server.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.3-3.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.3-10 of libapache-mod-dav and in version 2.0.51-1 of\nApache 2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mod\\_dav packages.\n\n\n",
