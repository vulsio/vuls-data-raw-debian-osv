	"details": "\nPhong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses\nElGamal keys for signing. This is a significant security failure\nwhich can lead to a compromise of almost all ElGamal keys used for\nsigning.\n\n\nThis update disables the use of this type of key.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.0.6-4woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution, this problem has been fixed in version\n1.2.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your gnupg package.\n\n\n",
