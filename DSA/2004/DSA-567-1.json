	"summary": "tiff - heap overflows",
	"details": "\nSeveral problems have been discovered in libtiff, the Tag Image File\nFormat library for processing TIFF graphics files. An attacker could\nprepare a specially crafted TIFF graphic that would cause the client\nto execute arbitrary code or crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures Project has identified the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0803](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0803)\nChris Evans discovered several problems in the RLE (run length\n encoding) decoders that could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n* [CAN-2004-0804](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0804)\nMatthias Clasen discovered a division by zero through an integer\n overflow.\n* [CAN-2004-0886](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0886)\nDmitry V. Levin discovered several integer overflows that caused\n malloc issues which can result to either plain crash or memory\n corruption.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.5.5-6woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.6.1-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libtiff package.\n\n\n",
