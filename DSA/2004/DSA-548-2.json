The updated packages we have\nprovided in DSA 548-1 did not seem to be sufficient, which should be\nfixed by this update.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.9.14-2woody3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.9.14-16.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.9.14-17 of imlib and in version 1.9.14-16.2 of imlib+png2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your imlib1 packages.\n\n\n",
