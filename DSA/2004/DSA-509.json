	"summary": "gatos - privilege escalation",
	"details": "\nSteve Kemp discovered a vulnerability in xatitv, one of the programs\nin the gatos package, which is used to display video with certain\nATI video cards.\n\n\nxatitv is installed setuid root in order to gain direct access to the\nvideo hardware. It normally drops root privileges after successfully\ninitializing itself. However, if initialization fails due to a\nmissing configuration file, root privileges are not dropped, and\nxatitv executes the system(3) function to launch its configuration\nprogram without sanitizing user-supplied environment variables.\n\n\nBy exploiting this vulnerability, a local user could gain root\nprivileges if the configuration file does not exist. However, a\ndefault configuration file is supplied with the package, and so this\nvulnerability is not exploitable unless this file is removed by the\nadministrator.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 0.0.5-6woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your gatos package.\n\n\n",
