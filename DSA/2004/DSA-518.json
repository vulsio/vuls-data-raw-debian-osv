	"details": "\niDEFENSE identified a vulnerability in the Opera web browser that\ncould be used by remote attackers to create or truncate arbitrary\nfiles on the victims machine. The KDE team discovered that a similar\n[\\\nvulnerability](http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20040517-1.txt) exists in KDE.\n\n\nA remote attacker could entice a user to open a carefully crafted\ntelnet URI which may either create or truncate a file in the victims\nhome directory. In KDE 3.2 and later versions the user is first\nexplicitly asked to confirm the opening of the telnet URI.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.2-13.woody.10.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your KDE libraries.\n\n\n",
