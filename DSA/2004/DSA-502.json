	"summary": "exim-tls - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nGeorgi Guninski discovered two stack-based buffer overflows in exim\nand exim-tls. They cannot be exploited with the default\nconfiguration from the Debian system, though. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems that are fixed with this update:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0399](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0399)\nWhen \"sender\\_verify = true\" is configured in exim.conf a buffer\n overflow can happen during verification of the sender. This\n problem is fixed in exim 4.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0400](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0400)\nWhen headers\\_check\\_syntax is configured in exim.conf a buffer\n overflow can happen during the header check. This problem does\n also exist in exim 4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.35-3woody2.\n\n\nThe unstable distribution (sid) does not contain exim-tls anymore.\nThe functionality has been incorporated in the main exim versions\nwhich have these problems fixed in version 3.36-11 for exim 3 and in\nversion 4.33-1 for exim 4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your exim-tls package.\n\n\n",
