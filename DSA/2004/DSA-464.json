	"details": "\nThomas Kristensen discovered a vulnerability in gdk-pixbuf (binary\npackage libgdk-pixbuf2), the GdkPixBuf image library for Gtk, that can\ncause the surrounding application to crash. To exploit this problem,\na remote attacker could send a carefully-crafted BMP file via mail,\nwhich would cause e.g. Evolution to crash but is probably not limited\nto Evolution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.17.0-2woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.22.0-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libgdk-pixbuf2 package.\n\n\n",
