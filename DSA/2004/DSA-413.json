	"details": "\nPaul Starzetz [discovered](http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0013-mremap.txt) a flaw in bounds checking in mremap() in the\nLinux kernel (present in version 2.4.x and 2.6.x) which may allow\na local attacker to gain root privileges.\nVersion 2.2 is not affected by this bug, since it doesn't support the\nMREMAP\\_FIXED flag (as [clarified later](http://seclists.org/lists/fulldisclosure/2004/Jan/0095.html)).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nkernel-source version 2.4.18-14.1 and kernel-images versions\n2.4.18-12.1 and 2.4.18-5woody6 (bf) for the i386 architecture.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon\nwith newly uploaded packages.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel packages. This problem has\nbeen fixed in the upstream version 2.4.24 as well.\n\n\n",
