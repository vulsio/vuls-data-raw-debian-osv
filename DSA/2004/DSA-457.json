	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in wu-ftpd:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0148](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0148)\nGlenn Stewart discovered that users could bypass the\n directory access restrictions imposed by the restricted-gid option by\n changing the permissions on their home directory. On a subsequent\n login, when access to the user's home directory was denied, wu-ftpd\n would fall back to the root directory.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0185](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0185)\nA buffer overflow existed in wu-ftpd's code which\n deals with S/key authentication.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6.2-3woody4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6.2-17.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your wu-ftpd package.\n\n\n",
