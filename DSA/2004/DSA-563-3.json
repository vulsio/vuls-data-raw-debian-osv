	"details": "\nThis advisory is an addition to DSA 563-1 and 563-2 which weren't able\nto supersede the library on sparc and arm due to a different version\nnumber for them in the stable archive. Other architectures were\nupdated properly. Another problem was reported in connection with\nsendmail, though, which should be fixed with this update as well.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.5.27-3.1woody5.\n\n\nFor reference the advisory text follows:\n\n\n\n> \n> A vulnerability has been discovered in the Cyrus implementation of the\n> SASL library, the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method\n> for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. The\n> library honors the environment variable SASL\\_PATH blindly, which\n> allows a local user to link against a malicious library to run\n> arbitrary code with the privileges of a setuid or setgid application.\n> \n> \n> For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\n> version 1.5.28-6.2 of cyrus-sasl and in version 2.1.19-1.3 of\n> cyrus-sasl2.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libsasl packages.\n\n\n",
