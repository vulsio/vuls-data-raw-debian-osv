A local\nuser can exploit this problem and execute arbitrary commands under the\nGID utmp. This could be used by an attacker to remove traces from the\nutmp file.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.11-9.1woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xitalk package.\n\n\n",
