	"details": "\nDavide Del Vecchio discovered a vulnerability in mpg123, a popular (but\nnon-free) MPEG layer 1/2/3 audio player. A malicious MPEG layer 2/3\nfile could cause the header checks in mpg123 to fail, which could in\nturn allow arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the\nuser running mpg123.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.59r-13woody3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.59r-16.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mpg123 package.\n\n\n",
