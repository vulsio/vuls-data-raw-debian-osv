	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in zgv, an SVGAlib\ngraphics viewer for the i386 architecture. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures Project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-1095](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1095)\n\"infamous41md\" discovered multiple\n integer overflows in zgv. Remote exploitation of an integer\n overflow vulnerability could allow the execution of arbitrary\n code.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0999](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0999)\nMikulas Patocka discovered that malicious multiple-image (e.g.\n animated) GIF images can cause a segmentation fault in zgv.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.5-3woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zgv package immediately.\n\n\n",
