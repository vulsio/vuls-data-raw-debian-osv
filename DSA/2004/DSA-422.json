	"summary": "cvs - remote vulnerability",
	"details": "\nThe account management of the CVS pserver (which is used to give remote\naccess to CVS repositories) uses a `CVSROOT/passwd` file in each\nrepository which contains the accounts and their authentication\ninformation as well as the name of the local unix account to use when a\npserver account is used. Since CVS performed no checking on what unix\naccount was specified anyone who could modify the `CVSROOT/passwd`\ncould gain access to all local users on the CVS server, including root.\n\n\nThis has been fixed in upstream version 1.11.11 by preventing pserver\nfrom running as root. For Debian this problem is solved in version\n1.11.1p1debian-9 in two different ways:\n\n\n* pserver is no longer allowed to use root to access repositories\n* a new `/etc/cvs-repouid` is introduced which can be used by the\n system administrator to override the unix account used to access a\n repository. More information on this change can be found at\n\n\nAdditionally, CVS pserver had a bug in parsing module requests which\ncould be used to create files and directories outside a repository.\nThis has been fixed upstream in version 1.11.11 and Debian version\n1.11.1p1debian-9.\n\n\nFinally, the umask used for “cvs init” and\n“cvs-makerepos” has been\nchanged to prevent repositories from being created with group write\npermissions.\n\n\n",
