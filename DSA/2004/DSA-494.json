	"details": "\nJack <> discovered a buffer overflow in\nident2, an implementation of the ident protocol (RFC1413), where a\nbuffer in the child\\_service function was slightly too small to hold\nall of the data which could be written into it. This vulnerability\ncould be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the ident2 daemon (by default, the \"identd\" user).\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.03-3woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your ident2 package.\n\n\n",
