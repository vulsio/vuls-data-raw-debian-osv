	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid, the\ninternet object cache, the popular WWW proxy cache. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-1999-0710](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-1999-0710)\nIt is possible to bypass access lists and scan arbitrary hosts and\n ports in the network through cachemgr.cgi, which is installed by\n default. This update disables this feature and introduces a\n configuration file (/etc/squid/cachemgr.conf) to control\n this behavior.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0918](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0918)\nThe asn\\_parse\\_header function (asn1.c) in the SNMP module for\n Squid allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via\n certain SNMP packets with negative length fields that causes a\n memory allocation error.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.6-2woody4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.5.7-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid package.\n\n\n",
