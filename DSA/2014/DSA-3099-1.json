	"details": "\nSimon McVittie discovered that the fix for \n[\\\nCVE-2014-3636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3636) was incorrect, as it did not fully address the underlying\ndenial-of-service vector. This update starts the D-Bus daemon as root\ninitially, so that it can properly raise its file descriptor count.\n\n\nIn addition, this update reverts the auth\\_timeout change in the\nprevious security update to its old value because the new value causes\nboot failures on some systems. See the README.Debian file for details\nhow to harden the D-Bus daemon against malicious local users.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problem have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.8-1+deb7u5.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable\ndistribution (sid), these problem have been fixed in version 1.8.10-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.\n\n\n",
