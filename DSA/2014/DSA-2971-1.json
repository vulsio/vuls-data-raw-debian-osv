	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in dbus, an asynchronous\ninter-process communication system. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-3477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3477)\nAlban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered that dbus-daemon sends an\n AccessDenied error to the service instead of a client when the\n client is prohibited from accessing the service. A local attacker\n could use this flaw to cause a bus-activated service that is not\n currently running to attempt to start, and fail, denying other users\n access to this service.\n* [CVE-2014-3532](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3532)\nAlban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered a bug in dbus-daemon's\n support for file descriptor passing. A malicious process could force\n system services or user applications to be disconnected from the\n D-Bus system by sending them a message containing a file descriptor,\n leading to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2014-3533](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3533)\nAlban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. and Alejandro MartĂ­nez SuĂĄrez\n discovered that a malicious process could force services to be\n disconnected from the D-Bus system by causing dbus-daemon to attempt\n to forward invalid file descriptors to a victim process, leading to\n a denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.8-1+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.8.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.\n\n\n",
