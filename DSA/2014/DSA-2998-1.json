Additionally, a buffer overrun affecting only\napplications explicitly set up for SRP has been fixed ([CVE-2014-3512](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3512)).\n\n\nDetailed descriptions of the vulnerabilities can be found at:\n[\\\nwww.openssl.org/news/secadv\\_20140806.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt)\n\n\nIt's important that you upgrade the libssl1.0.0 package and not just\nthe openssl package.\n\n\nAll applications linked to openssl need to be restarted. You can use\nthe checkrestart tool from the debian-goodies package to detect\naffected programs. Alternatively, you may reboot your system.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.1e-2+deb7u12.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed\nsoon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.1i-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\n",
