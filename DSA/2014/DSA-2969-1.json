A remote attacker able to supply specifically crafted input to\nan application using Email::Address for parsing, could use this flaw to\nmount a denial of service attack against the application.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.895-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.905-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.905-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libemail-address-perl packages.\n\n\n",
