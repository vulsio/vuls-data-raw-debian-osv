	"details": "\nTwo security vulnerabilities were discovered in Heirloom mailx, an \nimplementation of the mail command:\n\n\n* [CVE-2004-2771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2771)\nmailx interprets shell meta-characters in certain email\n addresses.\n* [CVE-2014-7844](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7844)\nAn unexpected feature of mailx treats syntactically valid email\n addresses as shell commands to execute.\n\n\nShell command execution can be re-enabled using the expandaddr\noption.\n\n\nNote that this security update does not remove all mailx facilities\nfor command execution, though. Scripts which send mail to addresses\nobtained from an untrusted source (such as a web form) should use the\n`--` separator before the email addresses (which was fixed to work\nproperly in this update), or they should be changed to invoke\n`mail -t` or `sendmail -i -t` instead, passing the recipient addresses\nas part of the mail header.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 12.5-2+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your heirloom-mailx packages.\n\n\n",
