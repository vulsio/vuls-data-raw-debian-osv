	"summary": "apt - security update",
	"details": "\nThe Google Security Team discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in\nthe HTTP transport code in apt-get. An attacker able to\nman-in-the-middle a HTTP request to an apt repository can trigger the\nbuffer overflow, leading to a crash of the http apt method binary, or\npotentially to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nTwo regression fixes were included in this update:\n\n\n* Fix regression from the previous update in DSA-3025-1 when the custom\n apt configuration option for Dir::state::lists is set to a relative\n path (#762160).\n* Fix regression in the reverification handling of cdrom: sources that\n may lead to incorrect hashsum warnings. Affected users need to run\n \"apt-cdrom add\" again after the update was applied.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.7.9+deb7u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.\n\n\n",
