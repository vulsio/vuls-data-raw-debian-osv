	"details": "\nA flaw was discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS\nlibrary, which can be exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker to\nmount a denial of service against PolarSSL servers that offer GCM\nciphersuites. Potentially clients are affected too if a malicious server\ndecides to execute the denial of service attack against its clients.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.9-1~deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.7-2.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.7-2.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.\n\n\n",
