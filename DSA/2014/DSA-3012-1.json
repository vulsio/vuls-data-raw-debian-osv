	"details": "\nTavis Ormandy discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the\ntransliteration module loading code in eglibc, Debian's version of the\nGNU C Library. As a result, an attacker who can supply a crafted\ndestination character set argument to iconv-related character\nconversation functions could achieve arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nThis update removes support of loadable gconv transliteration modules.\nBesides the security vulnerability, the module loading code had\nfunctionality defects which prevented it from working for the intended\npurpose.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.13-38+deb7u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.\n\n\n",
