A certificate\nvalidation could be reported sucessfully even in cases were an error\nwould prevent all verification steps to be performed.\n\n\nAn attacker doing a man-in-the-middle of a TLS connection could use this\nvulnerability to present a carefully crafted certificate that would be\naccepted by GnuTLS as valid even if not signed by one of the trusted\nauthorities.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.8.6-1+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.12.20-8+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.12.23-13.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.12.23-13.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.\n\n\n",
