	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in Fail2ban, a solution to ban hosts \nthat cause multiple authentication errors. When using Fail2ban to monitor\nPostfix or Cyrus IMAP logs, improper input validation in log parsing \ncould enable a remote attacker to trigger an IP ban on arbitrary \naddresses, resulting in denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.8.6-3wheezy3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.8.11-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.8.11-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your fail2ban packages.\n\n\n",
