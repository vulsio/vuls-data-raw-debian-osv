A local attacker could possibly use this issue\nto bypass file permissions and read arbitrary files, possibly leading\nto a privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.5.3-5+deb7u4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.7.4-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.\n\n\n",
