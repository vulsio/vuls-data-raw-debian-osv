	"details": "\nTwo buffer overflow vulnerabilities were reported in Graphviz, a rich\ncollection of graph drawing tools. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-0978](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0978)\nIt was discovered that user-supplied input used in the yyerror()\n function in lib/cgraph/scan.l is not bound-checked before beeing\n copied into an insufficiently sized memory buffer. A\n context-dependent attacker could supply a specially crafted input\n file containing a long line to cause a stack-based buffer overlow,\n resulting in a denial of service (application crash) or potentially\n allowing the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2014-1236](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1236)\nSebastian Krahmer reported an overflow condition in the chkNum()\n function in lib/cgraph/scan.l that is triggered as the used regular\n expression accepts an arbitrary long digit list. With a specially\n crafted input file, a context-dependent attacker can cause a\n stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service\n (application crash) or potentially allowing the execution of\n arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.26.3-5+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.26.3-14+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your graphviz packages.\n\n\n",
