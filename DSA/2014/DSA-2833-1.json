In addition this update disables the insecure Dual\\_EC\\_DRBG\nalgorithm (which was unused anyway, see\n<http://marc.info/?l=openssl-announce&m=138747119822324&w=2> for further\ninformation) and no longer uses the RdRand feature available on some\nIntel CPUs as a sole source of entropy unless explicitly requested.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.1e-2+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.1e-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\n",
