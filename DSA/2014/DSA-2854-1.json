	"details": "\nSeveral issues have been discovered in mumble, a low latency VoIP\nclient. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-0044](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0044)\nIt was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a\n Mumble client could trigger a NULL pointer dereference or an\n out-of-bounds array access. A malicious remote attacker could\n exploit this flaw to mount a denial of service attack against a\n mumble client by causing the application to crash.\n* [CVE-2014-0045](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0045)\nIt was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a\n Mumble client could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow. A\n malicious remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a client\n crash (denial of service) or potentially use it to execute\n arbitrary code.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by these problems.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.3-349-g315b5f5-2.2+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mumble packages.\n\n\n",
