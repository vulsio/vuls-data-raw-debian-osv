	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in MediaWiki, a wiki engine.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nissues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-2031](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2031)\nCross-site scripting attack via valid UTF-7 encoded sequences\n in a SVG file.\n* [CVE-2013-4567](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4567)\n & [CVE-2013-4568](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4568)\nKevin Israel (Wikipedia user PleaseStand) reported two ways\n to inject Javascript due to an incomplete blacklist in the\n CSS sanitizer function.\n* [CVE-2013-4572](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4572)\nMediaWiki and the CentralNotice extension were incorrectly setting\n cache headers when a user was autocreated, causing the user's\n session cookies to be cached, and returned to other users.\n* [CVE-2013-6452](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6452)\nChris from RationalWiki reported that SVG files could be\n uploaded that include external stylesheets, which could lead to\n XSS when an XSL was used to include JavaScript.\n* [CVE-2013-6453](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6453)\nMediaWiki's SVG sanitization could be bypassed when the XML was\n considered invalid.\n* [CVE-2013-6454](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6454)\nMediaWiki's CSS sanitization did not filter -o-link attributes,\n which could be used to execute JavaScript in Opera 12.\n* [CVE-2013-6472](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6472)\nMediaWiki displayed some information about deleted pages in\n the log API, enhanced RecentChanges, and user watchlists.\n* [CVE-2014-1610](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1610)\nA remote code execution vulnerability existed if file upload\n support for DjVu (natively handled) or PDF files (in\n combination with the PdfHandler extension) was enabled.\n Neither file type is enabled by default in MediaWiki.\n* [CVE-2014-2665](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2665)\nCross site request forgery in login form: an attacker could login\n a victim as the attacker.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:1.19.14+dfsg-0+deb7u1 of the mediawiki package and 3.5~deb7u1\nof the mediawiki-extensions package.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:1.19.14+dfsg-1 of the mediawiki package and 3.5 of the\nmediawiki-extensions package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.\n\n\n",
