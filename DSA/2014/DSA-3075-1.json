The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-9015](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9015)\nAaron Averill discovered that a specially crafted request can give a\n user access to another user's session, allowing an attacker to\n hijack a random session.\n* [CVE-2014-9016](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9016)\nMichael Cullum, Javier Nieto and Andres Rojas Guerrero discovered\n that the password hashing API allows an attacker to send\n specially crafted requests resulting in CPU and memory\n exhaustion. This may lead to the site becoming unavailable or\n unresponsive (denial of service).\n\n\nCustom configured session.inc and password.inc need to be audited as\nwell to verify if they are prone to these vulnerabilities. More\ninformation can be found in the upstream advisory at\n\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.14-2+deb7u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.\n\n\n",
