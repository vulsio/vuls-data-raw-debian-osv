	"details": "\nPedro Ribeiro from Agile Information Security found a possible remote \ncode execution on Horde3, a web application framework. Unsanitized\nvariables are passed to the unserialize() PHP function. A remote attacker\ncould specially-craft one of those variables allowing her to load and\nexecute code.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.3.8+debian0-3.\n\n\nIn the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, Horde is \ndistributed in the php-horde-util package. This problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.0-1. \n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your horde3 packages.\n\n\n",
