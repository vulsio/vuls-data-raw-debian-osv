	"details": "\nDuring a review for EDF, Raphael Geissert discovered that the\nacpi-support package did not properly handle data obtained from a\nuser's environment. This could lead to program malfunction or allow a\nlocal user to escalate privileges to the root user due to a programming\nerror.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.140-5+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), and the unstable distribution (sid)\nthis problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your acpi-support packages.\n\n\n",
