	"details": "\nIt was discovered that PHP, a general-purpose scripting language\ncommonly used for web application development, is vulnerable to a\nheap-based buffer overflow in the DNS TXT record parsing. A malicious\nserver or man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this flaw to\nexecute arbitrary code as the PHP interpreter if a PHP application uses\ndns\\_get\\_record() to perform a DNS query.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.4.4-14+deb7u11.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.6.0~beta4+dfsg-3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.6.0~beta4+dfsg-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.\n\n\n",
