	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSH, an implementation of the\nSSH protocol suite. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-2532](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2532)\nJann Horn discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled wildcards in\n AcceptEnv lines. A remote attacker could use this issue to trick\n OpenSSH into accepting any environment variable that contains the\n characters before the wildcard character.\n* [CVE-2014-2653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2653)\nMatthew Vernon reported that if a SSH server offers a\n HostCertificate that the ssh client doesn't accept, then the client\n doesn't check the DNS for SSHFP records. As a consequence a\n malicious server can disable SSHFP-checking by presenting a\n certificate.\n\n\nNote that a host verification prompt is still displayed before\n connecting.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:5.5p1-6+squeeze5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:6.0p1-4+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:6.6p1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.\n\n\n",
