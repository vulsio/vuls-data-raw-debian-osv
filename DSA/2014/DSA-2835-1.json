In stable and oldstable this option is disabled by default.\nTo enable it add the following line to the section '[options]' in\n/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf (and restart asterisk)\n\n\n\n```\nlive_dangerously = no\n```\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze12.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:1.8.13.1~dfsg1-3+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:11.7.0~dfsg-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:11.7.0~dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.\n\n\n",
