	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting\nlanguage commonly used for web application development. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-0207](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0207)\nFrancisco Alonso of the Red Hat Security Response Team reported an\n incorrect boundary check in the cdf\\_read\\_short\\_sector() function.\n* [CVE-2014-3478](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3478)\nFrancisco Alonso of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered a\n flaw in the way the truncated pascal string size in the mconvert()\n function is computed.\n* [CVE-2014-3479](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3479)\nFrancisco Alonso of the Red Hat Security Response Team reported an\n incorrect boundary check in the cdf\\_check\\_stream\\_offset() function.\n* [CVE-2014-3480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3480)\nFrancisco Alonso of the Red Hat Security Response Team reported an\n insufficient boundary check in the cdf\\_count\\_chain() function.\n* [CVE-2014-3487](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3487)\nFrancisco Alonso of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered an\n incorrect boundary check in the cdf\\_read\\_property\\_info() funtion.\n* [CVE-2014-3515](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3515)\nStefan Esser discovered that the ArrayObject and the\n SPLObjectStorage unserialize() handler do not verify the type of\n unserialized data before using it. A remote attacker could use this\n flaw to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2014-4721](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4721)\nStefan Esser discovered a type confusion issue affecting phpinfo(),\n which might allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from\n process memory.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.4.4-14+deb7u12. In addition, this update contains several\nbugfixes originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.6.0~rc2+dfsg-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.6.0~rc2+dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.\n\n\n",
