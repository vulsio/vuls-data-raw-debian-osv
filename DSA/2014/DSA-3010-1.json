	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python\nweb development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-0480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0480)\nFlorian Apolloner discovered that in certain situations, URL\n reversing could generate scheme-relative URLs which could\n unexpectedly redirect a user to a different host, leading to\n phishing attacks.\n* [CVE-2014-0481](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0481)\nDavid Wilson reported a file upload denial of service vulnerability.\n Django's file upload handling in its default configuration may\n degrade to producing a huge number of `os.stat()` system calls when\n a duplicate filename is uploaded. A remote attacker with the ability\n to upload files can cause poor performance in the upload handler,\n eventually causing it to become very slow.\n* [CVE-2014-0482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0482)\nDavid Greisen discovered that under some circumstances, the use of\n the RemoteUserMiddleware middleware and the RemoteUserBackend\n authentication backend could result in one user receiving another\n user's session, if a change to the REMOTE\\_USER header occurred\n without corresponding logout/login actions.\n* [CVE-2014-0483](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0483)\nCollin Anderson discovered that it is possible to reveal any field's\n data by modifying the popup and to\\_field parameters of the query\n string on an admin change form page. A user with access to the admin\n interface, and with sufficient knowledge of model structure and the\n appropriate URLs, could construct popup views which would display\n the values of non-relationship fields, including fields the\n application developer had not intended to expose in such a fashion.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.5-1+deb7u8.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\n",
