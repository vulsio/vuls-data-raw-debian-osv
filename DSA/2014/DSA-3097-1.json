	"summary": "unbound - security update",
	"details": "\nFlorian Maury from ANSSI discovered that unbound, a validating,\nrecursive, and caching DNS resolver, was prone to a denial of service\nvulnerability. An attacker crafting a malicious zone and able to emit\n(or make emit) queries to the server can trick the resolver into\nfollowing an endless series of delegations, leading to resource\nexhaustion and huge network usage.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.17-3+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.4.22-3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.22-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unbound packages.\n\n\n",
