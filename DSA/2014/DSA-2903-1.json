	"summary": "strongswan - security update",
	"details": "\nAn authentication bypass vulnerability was found in charon, the daemon\nhandling IKEv2 in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite. The state machine\nhandling the security association (IKE\\_SA) handled some state transitions\nincorrectly.\n\n\nAn attacker can trigger the vulnerability by rekeying an unestablished\nIKE\\_SA during the initiation itself. This will trick the IKE\\_SA state to\nestablished without the need to provide any valid credential.\n\n\nVulnerable setups include those actively initiating IKEv2 IKE\\_SA (like\nâclientsâ or âroadwarriorsâ) but also during re-authentication (which\ncan be initiated by the responder). Installations using IKEv1 (pluto\ndaemon in strongSwan 4 and earlier, and IKEv1 code in charon 5.x) is not\naffected.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.4.1-5.5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.1.2-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\n",
