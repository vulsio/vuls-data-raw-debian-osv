	"details": "\nMartin Holst Swende discovered a flaw in the way chunked requests are\nhandled in ModSecurity, an Apache module whose purpose is to tighten the\nWeb application security. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nbypass intended mod\\_security restrictions by using chunked transfer\ncoding with a capitalized Chunked value in the Transfer-Encoding HTTP\nheader, allowing to send requests containing content that should have\nbeen removed by mod\\_security.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.6-6+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.7.7-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.7.7-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your modsecurity-apache packages.\n\n\n",
