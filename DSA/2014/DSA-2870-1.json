	"summary": "libyaml-libyaml-perl - heap-based buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nFlorian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a\nheap-based buffer overflow flaw in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and\nemitter library. A remote attacker could provide a YAML document with a\nspecially-crafted tag that, when parsed by an application using libyaml,\nwould cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running the application.\n\n\nThis update corrects this flaw in the copy that is embedded in the\nlibyaml-libyaml-perl package.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.33-1+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.38-3+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.41-4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.41-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libyaml-libyaml-perl packages.\n\n\n",
