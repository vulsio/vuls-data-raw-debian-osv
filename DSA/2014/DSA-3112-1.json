A specially crafted wav file could cause an application using\nSoX to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 14.4.0-3+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable\ndistribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.\n\n\n",
