	"details": "\nMultiple security issues were found in the Tomcat servlet and JSP engine:\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-2067](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2067)\nFORM authentication associates the most recent request requiring \n authentication with the current session. By repeatedly sending a request \n for an authenticated resource while the victim is completing the login \n form, an attacker could inject a request that would be executed using the \n victim's credentials.\n* [CVE-2013-2071](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2071)\nA runtime exception in AsyncListener.onComplete() prevents the request from \n being recycled. This may expose elements of a previous request to a current \n request.\n* [CVE-2013-4286](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4286)\nReject requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length \n header when chunked encoding is being used.\n* [CVE-2013-4322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4322)\nWhen processing a request submitted using the chunked transfer encoding, \n Tomcat ignored but did not limit any extensions that were included. This allows \n a client to perform a limited denial of service by streaming an unlimited amount \n of data to the server.\n* [CVE-2014-0050](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0050)\nMultipart requests with a malformed Content-Type header could trigger an \n infinite loop causing a denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.0.28-4+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.0.52-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.0.52-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.\n\n\n",
