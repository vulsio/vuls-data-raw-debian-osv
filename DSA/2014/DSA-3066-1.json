	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor\nemulator.\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-3689](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3689)\nThe Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security reported that\n guest provided parameter were insufficiently validated in\n rectangle functions in the vmware-vga driver. A privileged guest\n user could use this flaw to write into qemu address space on the\n host, potentially escalating their privileges to those of the\n qemu host process.\n* [CVE-2014-7815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7815)\nJames Spadaro of Cisco reported insufficiently sanitized\n bits\\_per\\_pixel from the client in the QEMU VNC display driver. An\n attacker having access to the guest's VNC console could use this\n flaw to crash the guest.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.1+dfsg-7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.\n\n\n",
