	"summary": "linux-2.6 - several",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead\nto a denial of service, information leak or privilege escalation. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-0343](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0343)\nGeorge Kargiotakis reported an issue in the temporary address handling\n of the IPv6 privacy extensions. Users on the same LAN can cause a denial\n of service or obtain access to sensitive information by sending router\n advertisement messages that cause temporary address generation to be\n disabled.\n* [CVE-2013-2147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2147)\nDan Carpenter reported issues in the cpqarray driver for Compaq\n Smart2 Controllers and the cciss driver for HP Smart Array controllers\n allowing users to gain access to sensitive kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2013-2889](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2889)\nKees Cook discovered missing input sanitization in the HID driver for\n Zeroplus game pads that could lead to a local denial of service.\n* [CVE-2013-2893](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2893)\nKees Cook discovered that missing input sanitization in the HID driver\n for various Logitech force feedback devices could lead to a local denial\n of service.\n* [CVE-2013-2929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2929)\nVasily Kulikov discovered that a flaw in the get\\_dumpable() function of\n the ptrace subsytsem could lead to information disclosure. Only systems\n with the fs.suid\\_dumpable sysctl set to a non-default value of 2 are\n vulnerable.\n* [CVE-2013-4162](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4162)\nHannes Frederic Sowa discovered that incorrect handling of IPv6 sockets\n using the UDP\\_CORK option could result in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2013-4299](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4299)\nFujitsu reported an issue in the device-mapper subsystem. Local users\n could gain access to sensitive kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2013-4345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4345)\nStephan Mueller found in bug in the ANSI pseudo random number generator\n which could lead to the use of less entropy than expected.\n* [CVE-2013-4512](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4512)\nNico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported an issue in the user mode\n linux port. A buffer overflow condition exists in the write method\n for the /proc/exitcode file. Local users with sufficient privileges\n allowing them to write to this file could gain further elevated\n privileges.\n* [CVE-2013-4587](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4587)\nAndrew Honig of Google reported an issue in the KVM virtualization\n subsystem. A local user could gain elevated privileges by passing\n a large vcpu\\_id parameter.\n* [CVE-2013-6367](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6367)\nAndrew Honig of Google reported an issue in the KVM virtualization\n subsystem. A divide-by-zero condition could allow a guest user to\n cause a denial of service on the host (crash).\n* [CVE-2013-6380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6380)\nMahesh Rajashekhara reported an issue in the aacraid driver for storage\n products from various vendors. Local users with CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN privileges\n could gain further elevated privileges.\n* [CVE-2013-6381](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6381)\nNico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported an issue in the Gigabit Ethernet\n device support for s390 systems. Local users could cause a denial of\n service or gain elevated privileges via the SIOC\\_QETH\\_ADP\\_SET\\_SNMP\\_CONTROL\n ioctl.\n* [CVE-2013-6382](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6382)\nNico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported an issue in the XFS filesystem.\n Local users with CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN privileges could gain further elevated\n privileges.\n* [CVE-2013-6383](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6383)\nDan Carpenter reported an issue in the aacraid driver for storage devices\n from various vendors. A local user could gain elevated privileges due to\n a missing privilege level check in the aac\\_compat\\_ioctl function.\n* [CVE-2013-7263](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7263)\n[CVE-2013-7264](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7264)\n[CVE-2013-7265](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7265)\nmpb reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg and recvmsg\n system calls. A local user could obtain access to sensitive kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2013-7339](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7339)\nSasha Levin reported an issue in the RDS network protocol over Infiniband.\n A local user could cause a denial of service condition.\n* [CVE-2014-0101](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0101)\nNokia Siemens Networks reported an issue in the SCTP network protocol\n subsystem. Remote users could cause a denial of service (NULL pointer\n dereference).\n* [CVE-2014-1444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1444)\nSalva Peiro reported an issue in the FarSync WAN driver. Local users\n with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability could gain access to sensitive kernel\n memory.\n* [CVE-2014-1445](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1445)\nSalva Peiro reported an issue in the wanXL serial card driver. Local\n users could gain access to sensitive kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2014-1446](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1446)\nSalva Peiro reported an issue in the YAM radio modem driver. Local users\n with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability could gain access to sensitive kernel\n memory.\n* [CVE-2014-1874](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1874)\nMatthew Thode reported an issue in the SELinux subsystem. A local user\n with CAP\\_MAC\\_ADMIN privileges could cause a denial of service by setting\n an empty security context on a file.\n* [CVE-2014-2039](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2039)\nMartin Schwidefsky reported an issue on s390 systems. A local user\n could cause a denial of service (kernel oops) by executing an application\n with a linkage stack instruction.\n* [CVE-2014-2523](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2523)\nDaniel Borkmann provided a fix for an issue in the nf\\_conntrack\\_dccp\n module. Remote users could cause a denial of service (system crash)\n or potentially gain elevated privileges.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.32-48squeeze5.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 6.0 (squeeze) |\n| --- | --- |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.32-1um-4+48squeeze5 |\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.\n**Note**: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every\nlinux kernel package in all releases under active security support.\nHowever, given the high frequency at which low-severity security\nissues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of\ndoing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not\nbe released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be\nreleased in a staggered or leap-frog fashion.\n\n\n\n\n",
