	"details": "\nAntoine Delignat-Lavaud from Inria discovered an issue in the way NSS\n(the Mozilla Network Security Service library) was parsing ASN.1 data\nused in signatures, making it vulnerable to a signature forgery attack.\n\n\nAn attacker could craft ASN.1 data to forge RSA certificates with a\nvalid certification chain to a trusted CA.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:3.14.5-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:3.17.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:3.17.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.\n\n\n",
