	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-7841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7841)\nLiu Wei of Red Hat discovered that a SCTP server doing ASCONF will\n panic on malformed INIT chunks by triggering a NULL pointer\n dereference.\n* [CVE-2014-8369](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8369)\nA flaw was discovered in the way iommu mapping failures were handled\n in the kvm\\_iommu\\_map\\_pages() function in the Linux kernel. A guest\n OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host\n OS memory corruption) or possibly have other unspecified impact on\n the host OS.\n* [CVE-2014-8884](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8884)\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the\n TechnoTrend/Hauppauge DEC USB driver. A local user with write access\n to the corresponding device could use this flaw to crash the kernel\n or, potentially, elevate their privileges.\n* [CVE-2014-9090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9090)\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that the do\\_double\\_fault function in\n arch/x86/kernel/traps.c in the Linux kernel did not properly handle\n faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) segment register,\n which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.2.63-2+deb7u2. This update also includes fixes for regressions\nintroduced by previous updates.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon\nin version 3.16.7-ckt2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\n",
