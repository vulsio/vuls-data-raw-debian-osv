	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been found in memcached, a high-performance\nmemory object caching system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-4971](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4971)\nStefan Bucur reported that memcached could be caused to crash by\n sending a specially crafted packet.\n* [CVE-2013-7239](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7239)\nIt was reported that SASL authentication could be bypassed due to a\n flaw related to the managment of the SASL authentication state. With\n a specially crafted request, a remote attacker may be able to\n authenticate with invalid SASL credentials.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.4.5-1+deb6u1. Note that the patch for [CVE-2013-7239](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7239) was not\napplied for the oldstable distribution as SASL support is not enabled in\nthis version. This update also provides the fix for [CVE-2013-0179](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0179) which\nwas fixed for stable already.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.13-0.2+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.\n\n\n",
