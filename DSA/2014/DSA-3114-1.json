	"details": "\nTimothy D. Morgan discovered that run-mailcap, an utility to execute\nprograms via entries in the mailcap file, is prone to shell command\ninjection via shell meta-characters in filenames. In specific scenarios\nthis flaw could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.52-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable\ndistribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mime-support packages.\n\n\n",
