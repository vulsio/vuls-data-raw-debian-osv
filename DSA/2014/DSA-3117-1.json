	"summary": "php5 - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting\nlanguage commonly used for web application development.\n\n\nAs announced in DSA 3064-1 it has been decided to follow the stable\n5.4.x releases for the Wheezy php5 packages. Consequently the\nvulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading PHP to a new upstream version\n5.4.36, which includes additional bug fixes, new features and possibly\nincompatible changes. Please refer to the upstream changelog for more\ninformation:\n\n\n\nTwo additional patches were applied on top of the imported new upstream\nversion. An out-of-bounds read flaw was fixed which could lead php5-cgi\nto crash. Moreover a bug with php5-pgsql in combination with PostgreSQL\n9.1 was fixed \n([\\\nDebian Bug #773182](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=773182)).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.4.36-0+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.\n\n\n",
