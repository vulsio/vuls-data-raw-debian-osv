The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-4341](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4341)\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject\n packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session\n can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when\n attempting to read beyond the end of a buffer.\n* [CVE-2014-4342](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4342)\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject\n packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session\n can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when\n reading beyond the end of a buffer or by causing a null pointer\n dereference.\n* [CVE-2014-4343](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4343)\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to spoof packets\n appearing to be from a GSSAPI acceptor can cause a double-free\n condition in GSSAPI initiators (clients) which are using the SPNEGO\n mechanism, by returning a different underlying mechanism than was\n proposed by the initiator. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw\n to cause an application crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2014-4344](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4344)\nAn unauthenticated or partially authenticated remote attacker can\n cause a NULL dereference and application crash during a SPNEGO\n negotiation by sending an empty token as the second or later context\n token from initiator to acceptor.\n* [CVE-2014-4345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4345)\nWhen kadmind is configured to use LDAP for the KDC database, an\n authenticated remote attacker can cause it to perform an\n out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.12.1+dfsg-7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.\n\n\n",
