	],
	"summary": "bsd-mailx - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that bsd-mailx, an implementation of the mail \ncommand, had an undocumented feature which treats syntactically valid \nemail addresses as shell commands to execute.\n\n\nUsers who need this feature can re-enable it using the expandaddr in \nan appropriate mailrc file. This update also removes the obsolete \n`-T` option. An older security vulnerability, \n[\\\nCVE-2004-2771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2771), had already been addressed in the Debian's bsd-mailx \npackage.\n\n\nNote that this security update does not remove all mailx facilities \nfor command execution, though. Scripts which send mail to addresses \nobtained from an untrusted source (such as a web form) should use the \n`--` separator before the email addresses (which was fixed to work \nproperly in this update), or they should be changed to invoke \n`mail -t` or `sendmail -i -t` instead, passing the \nrecipient addresses as part of the mail header.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 8.1.2-0.20111106cvs-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bsd-mailx packages.\n\n\n",
