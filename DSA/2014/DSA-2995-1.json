	"summary": "lzo2 - security update",
	"details": "\nDon A. Bailey from Lab Mouse Security discovered an integer overflow\nflaw in the way the lzo library decompressed certain archives compressed\nwith the LZO algorithm. An attacker could create a specially crafted\nLZO-compressed input that, when decompressed by an application using the\nlzo library, would cause that application to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.06-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.08-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.08-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lzo2 packages.\n\n\n",
