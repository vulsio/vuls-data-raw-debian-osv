	"summary": "file - several",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in file, a file type\nclassification tool.\n\n\nAaron Reffett reported a flaw in the way the file utility determined the\ntype of Portable Executable (PE) format files, the executable format\nused on Windows. When processing a defective or intentionally prepared\nPE executable which contains invalid offset information, the\nfile\\_strncmp routine will access memory that is out of bounds, causing\nfile to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ID\n[CVE-2014-2270](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2270) has been assigned to identify this flaw.\n\n\nMike Frysinger reported that file's rule for detecting AWK scripts\nsignificantly slows down file. The regular expression to detect AWK\nfiles contained two star operators, which could be exploited to cause\nexcessive backtracking in the regex engine.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 5.04-5+squeeze4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.11-2+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:5.17-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:5.17-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your file packages.\n\n\n",
