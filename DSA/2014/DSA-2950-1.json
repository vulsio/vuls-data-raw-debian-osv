All applications linked to openssl need to\nbe restarted. You can use the tool checkrestart from the package\ndebian-goodies to detect affected programs or reboot your system. There's\nalso a forthcoming security update for the Linux kernel later the day\n([CVE-2014-3153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3153)), so you need to reboot anyway. Perfect timing, isn't it?\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\n",
