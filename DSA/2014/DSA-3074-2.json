	"details": "\nFrancisco Alonso of Red Hat Product Security found an issue in the file\nutility, whose code is embedded in PHP, a general-purpose scripting\nlanguage. When checking ELF files, note headers are incorrectly\nchecked, thus potentially allowing attackers to cause a denial of\nservice (out-of-bounds read and application crash) by supplying a\nspecially crafted ELF file.\n\n\nAs announced in DSA-3064-1 it has been decided to follow the stable\n5.4.x releases for the Wheezy php5 packages. Consequently the\nvulnerability is addressed by upgrading PHP to a new upstream version\n5.4.35, which includes additional bug fixes, new features and possibly\nincompatible changes. Please refer to the upstream changelog for more\ninformation:\n\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.4.35-0+deb7u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.\n\n\n",
