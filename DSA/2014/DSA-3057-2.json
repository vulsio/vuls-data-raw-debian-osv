	"details": "\nSogeti found a denial of service flaw in libxml2, a library providing\nsupport to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker\ncould provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by an\napplication using libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption\n(denial of service) based on excessive entity substitutions, even if\nentity substitution was disabled, which is the parser default behavior.\n([CVE-2014-3660](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3660))\n\n\nIn addition, this update addresses a misapplied chunk for a patch\nreleased in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy1 (#762864), and a memory leak\nregression (#765770) introduced in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.9.2+dfsg1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.\n\n\n",
