	"details": "\nIvan Fratric of the Google Security Team discovered a heap-based buffer\noverflow vulnerability in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and emitter\nlibrary. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML\ndocument that, when parsed by an application using libyaml, would cause\nthe application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user running the application.\n\n\nThis update corrects this flaw in the copy that is embedded in the\nlibyaml-libyaml-perl package.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.33-1+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.38-3+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.41-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libyaml-libyaml-perl packages.\n\n\n",
