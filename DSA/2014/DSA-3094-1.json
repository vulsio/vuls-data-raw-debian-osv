	"summary": "bind9 - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, is prone to a denial of \nservice vulnerability.\n\n\nBy making use of maliciously-constructed zones or a rogue server, an \nattacker can exploit an oversight in the code BIND 9 uses to follow \ndelegations in the Domain Name Service, causing BIND to issue unlimited \nqueries in an attempt to follow the delegation.\n\n\nThis can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service \n(up to and including termination of the named server process.)\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be\nfixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\n",
