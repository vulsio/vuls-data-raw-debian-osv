	"details": "\nAn integer underflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the ksba\\_oid\\_to\\_str() function of libksba, an X.509 and CMS\n(PKCS#7) library. By using special crafted S/MIME messages or ECC based\nOpenPGP data, it is possible to create a buffer overflow, which could\ncause an application using libksba to crash (denial of service), or\npotentially, execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.0-2+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.3.2-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libksba packages.\n\n\n",
