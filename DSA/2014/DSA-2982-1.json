	"details": "\nSean Griffin discovered two vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL adapter \nfor Active Record which could lead to SQL injection.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.2.6-5+deb7u1. Debian provides two variants of Ruby on Rails \nin Wheezy (2.3 and 3.2). Support for the 2.3 variants had to be ceased \nat this point. This affects the following source packages: \nruby-actionmailer-2.3, ruby-actionpack-2.3, ruby-activerecord-2.3, \nruby-activeresource-2.3, ruby-activesupport-2.3 and ruby-rails-2.3. The\nversion of Redmine in Wheezy still requires 2.3, you can use an updated\nversion from backports.debian.org which is compatible with rails 3.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.2.19-1 of the rails-3.2 source package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-activerecord-3.2 packages.\n\n\n",
