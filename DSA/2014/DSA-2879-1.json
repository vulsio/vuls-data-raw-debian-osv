	"summary": "libssh - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that libssh, a tiny C SSH library, did not reset the\nstate of the PRNG after accepting a connection. A server mode\napplication that forks itself to handle incoming connections could see\nits children sharing the same PRNG state, resulting in a cryptographic\nweakness and possibly the recovery of the private key.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.4.5-3+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.5.4-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.5.4-3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.5.4-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.\n\n\n",
