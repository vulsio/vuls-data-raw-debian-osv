	"summary": "vlc - security update",
	"details": "\nHans Jerry Illikainen discovered a type conversion vulnerability in the\nMP4 demuxer of the VLC media player, which could result in the execution\nof arbitrary code if a malformed media file is played.\n\n\nThis update upgrades VLC in stretch to the new 3.x release series (as\nsecurity fixes couldn't be sensibly backported to the 2.x series). In\naddition two packages needed to be rebuild to ensure compatibility with\nVLC 3; phonon-backend-vlc (0.9.0-2+deb9u1) and goldencheetah\n(4.0.0~DEV1607-2+deb9u1).\n\n\nVLC in jessie cannot be migrated to version 3 due to incompatible\nlibrary changes with reverse dependencies and is thus now declared\nend-of-life for jessie. We recommend to upgrade to stretch or pick a\ndifferent media player if that's not an option.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.0.2-0+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of vlc please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/vlc](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/vlc)\n\n\n",
