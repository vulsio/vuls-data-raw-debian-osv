	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid3, a fully featured\nweb proxy cache. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-1000024](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000024)\nLouis Dion-Marcil discovered that Squid does not properly handle\n processing of certain ESI responses. A remote server delivering\n certain ESI response syntax can take advantage of this flaw to cause\n a denial of service for all clients accessing the Squid service.\n This problem is limited to the Squid custom ESI parser.\n* [CVE-2018-1000027](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000027)\nLouis Dion-Marcil discovered that Squid is prone to a denial of\n service vulnerability when processing ESI responses or downloading\n intermediate CA certificates. A remote attacker can take advantage\n of this flaw to cause a denial of service for all clients accessing\n the Squid service.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.4.8-6+deb8u5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.5.23-5+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of squid3 please refer to \nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squid3](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squid3)\n\n\n",
