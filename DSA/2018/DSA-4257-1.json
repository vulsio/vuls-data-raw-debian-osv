	"details": "\nJann Horn discovered that FUSE, a Filesystem in USErspace, allows the\nbypass of the user\\_allow\\_other restriction when SELinux is active\n(including in permissive mode). A local user can take advantage of this\nflaw in the fusermount utility to bypass the system configuration and\nmount a FUSE filesystem with the allow\\_other mount option.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.9.7-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your fuse packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of fuse please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/fuse>\n\n\n",
