	"summary": "openocd - security update",
	"details": "\nJosef Gajdusek discovered that OpenOCD, a JTAG debugger for ARM and MIPS,\nwas vulnerable to Cross Protocol Scripting attacks. An attacker could\ncraft a HTML page that, when visited by a victim running OpenOCD, could\nexecute arbitrary commands on the victims host.\n\n\nThis fix also sets the OpenOCD default binding to localhost, instead of\nevery network interfaces. This can be changed with the added bindto\ncommand argument.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed\nin version 0.8.0-4+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.0-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openocd packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openocd please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openocd](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openocd)\n\n\n",
