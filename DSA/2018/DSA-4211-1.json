	"details": "\nGabriel Corona discovered that xdg-utils, a set of tools for desktop\nenvironment integration, is vulnerable to argument injection attacks. If\nthe environment variable BROWSER in the victim host has a \"%s\" and the\nvictim opens a link crafted by an attacker with xdg-open, the malicious\nparty could manipulate the parameters used by the browser when opened.\nThis manipulation could set, for example, a proxy to which the network\ntraffic could be intercepted for that particular execution.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1.1.0~rc1+git20111210-7.4+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.1-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xdg-utils packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of xdg-utils please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xdg-utils](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xdg-utils)\n\n\n",
