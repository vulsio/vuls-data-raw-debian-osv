In addition,\nthe package provides the Xen PTI stage 1 mitigation which is built-in\nand enabled by default on Intel systems, but can be disabled with\n`xpti=false' on the hypervisor command line (It does not make sense to\nuse both xpti and the Comet shim.)\n\n\nPlease refer to the following URL for more details on how to configure\nindividual mitigation strategies:\n[\\\nhttps://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html)\n\n\nAdditional information can also be found in README.pti and README.comet.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.8.3+comet2+shim4.10.0+comet3-1+deb9u4.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of xen please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xen](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xen)\n\n\n",
