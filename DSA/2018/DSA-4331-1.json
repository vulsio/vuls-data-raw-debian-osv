This would in turn cause a very small buffer to be\n allocated instead of the intended very huge one, which would trigger\n a heap buffer overflow when the buffer is used.\n* [CVE-2018-16842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16842)\nBrian Carpenter discovered that the logic in the curl tool to wrap\n error messages at 80 columns is flawed, leading to a read buffer\n overflow if a single word in the message is itself longer than 80\n bytes.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.52.1-5+deb9u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of curl please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl)\n\n\n",
