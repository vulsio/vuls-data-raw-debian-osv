	"summary": "thunderbird - security update",
	"details": "\nMultiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory\nsafety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary\ncode or denial of service.\n\n\nDebian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x\nseries has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the\n60.x releases.\n\n\nBetween 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal\nupdates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For\nmore information please refer to [\\\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60)\n\n\nIn addition, the new Thunderbird packages require Rust to build. A\ncompatible Rust toolchain has been backported to Debian stretch, but is\nnot available for all architectures which previously supported the\npurely C++-based Thunderbird packages. Thus, the new Thunderbird packages\ndon't support the mips, mips64el and mipsel architectures at this point.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:60.0-3~deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of thunderbird please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/thunderbird](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/thunderbird)\n\n\n",
