	"details": "\nSze Yiu Chau and his team from Purdue University and The University of Iowa\nfound several issues in the gmp plugin for strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite.\n\n\nProblems in the parsing and verification of RSA signatures could lead to a\nBleichenbacher-style low-exponent signature forgery in certificates and during\nIKE authentication.\n\n\nWhile the gmp plugin doesn't allow arbitrary data after the ASN.1 structure\n(the original Bleichenbacher attack), the ASN.1 parser is not strict enough and\nallows data in specific fields inside the ASN.1 structure.\n\n\nOnly installations using the gmp plugin are affected (on Debian OpenSSL plugin\nhas priority over GMP one for RSA operations), and only when using keys and\ncertificates (including ones from CAs) using keys with an exponent e = 3, which\nis usually rare in practice.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-16151](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16151)\nThe OID parser in the ASN.1 code in gmp allows any number of random bytes\n after a valid OID.\n* [CVE-2018-16152](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16152)\nThe algorithmIdentifier parser in the ASN.1 code in gmp doesn't enforce a\n NULL value for the optional parameter which is not used with any PKCS#1\n algorithm.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.5.1-4+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of strongswan please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan)\n\n\n",
