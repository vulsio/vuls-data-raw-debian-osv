	"details": "\nMultiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in the way the\nIntel processor designs have implemented speculative execution of\ninstructions in combination with handling of page-faults. This flaw\ncould allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read\nmemory from arbitrary (non-user controlled) addresses, including from\nthe kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross\nguest/host boundaries to read host memory.\n\n\nTo fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install\nupdated CPU microcode (only available in Debian non-free). Common server\nclass CPUs are covered in the update released as DSA 4273-1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.9.110-3+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>\n\n\n",
