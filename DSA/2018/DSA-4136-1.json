A malicious server\n might cause libcurl-using applications that allow LDAP URLs, or that\n allow redirects to LDAP URLs to crash.\n* [CVE-2018-1000122](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000122)\nOSS-fuzz, assisted by Max Dymond, discovered that curl could be\n tricked into copying data beyond the end of its heap based buffer\n when asked to transfer an RTSP URL.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 7.38.0-4+deb8u10.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.52.1-5+deb9u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of curl please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>\n\n\n",
