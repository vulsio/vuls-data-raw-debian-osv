	"details": "\nGoogle's OSS-Fuzz revealed an exploitable bug in the gmp plugin caused by the\npatch that fixes [\\\nCVE-2018-16151](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16151) and [\\\nCVE-2018-16152](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16152) (DSA-4305-1).\n\n\nAn attacker could trigger it using crafted certificates with RSA keys with\nvery small moduli. Verifying signatures with such keys would cause an integer\nunderflow and subsequent heap buffer overflow resulting in a crash of the\ndaemon. While arbitrary code execution is not completely ruled out because of\nthe heap buffer overflow, due to the form of the data written to the buffer\nit seems difficult to actually exploit it in such a way.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.5.1-4+deb9u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of strongswan please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan)\n\n\n",
