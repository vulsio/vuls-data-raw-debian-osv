The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-3738](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3738)\nDavid Benjamin of Google reported an overflow bug in the AVX2\n Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with\n 1024-bit moduli.\n* [CVE-2018-0739](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-0739)\nIt was discovered that constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive\n definition could exceed the stack, potentially leading to a denial\n of service.\n\n\nDetails can be found in the upstream advisory:\n<https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20180327.txt>\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.0.1t-1+deb8u8. The oldstable distribution is not affected\nby [CVE-2017-3738](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3738).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1.0f-3+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openssl please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssl>\n\n\n",
