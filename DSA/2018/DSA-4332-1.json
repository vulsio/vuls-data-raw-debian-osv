The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-16395](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16395)\nTyler Eckstein reported that the equality check of\n OpenSSL::X509::Name could return true for non-equal objects. If a\n malicious X.509 certificate is passed to compare with an existing\n certificate, there is a possibility to be judged incorrectly that\n they are equal.\n* [CVE-2018-16396](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16396)\nChris Seaton discovered that tainted flags are not propagated in\n Array#pack and String#unpack with some directives.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.3.3-1+deb9u4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.3 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of ruby2.3 please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby2.3>\n\n\n",
