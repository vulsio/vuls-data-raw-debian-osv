This was\n already fixed in Debian stretch and only affects Debian jessie.\n* [CVE-2018-6764](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6764)\nPedro Sampaio discovered that LXC containers detected the hostname\n insecurely. This only affects Debian stretch.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.2.9-9+deb8u5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.0.0-4+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libvirt please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libvirt>\n\n\n",
