	"details": "\nFrediano Ziglio reported a missing check in the script to generate\ndemarshalling code in the SPICE protocol client and server library. The\ngenerated demarshalling code is prone to multiple buffer overflows. An\nauthenticated attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial\nof service (spice server crash), or possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.12.8-2.1+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of spice please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/spice>\n\n\n",
