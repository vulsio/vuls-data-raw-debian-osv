	"details": "\nThe Shopify Application Security Team reported that ruby-loofah, a\ngeneral library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML documents and\nfragments, allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present in sanitized\noutput when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments. This might\nallow to mount a code injection attack into a browser consuming\nsanitized output.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.0.3-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-loofah packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of ruby-loofah please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-loofah>\n\n\n",
