	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-5715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5715)\nMultiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various\n processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker\n controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary\n addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes\n running on the system.\n\n\nThis specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch\n target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64\n and i386) by using the retpoline compiler feature which allows\n indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.\n* [CVE-2017-5753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5753)\nMultiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various\n processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker\n controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary\n addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes\n running on the system.\n\n\nThis specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1\n (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable\n code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and\n replacing the array access with the speculation-safe\n array\\_index\\_nospec() function.\n\n\nMore use sites will be added over time.\n* [CVE-2017-17975](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17975)\nTuba Yavuz reported a use-after-free flaw in the USBTV007\n audio-video grabber driver. A local user could use this for denial\n of service by triggering failure of audio registration.\n* [CVE-2017-18193](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18193)\nYunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly\n handle extent trees, allowing a local user to cause a denial of\n service via an application with multiple threads.\n* [CVE-2017-18216](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18216)\nAlex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a\n necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,\n potentially leading to a null pointer dereference. A local user\n could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-18218](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18218)\nJun He reported a use-after-free flaw in the Hisilicon HNS ethernet\n driver. A local user could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-18222](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18222)\nIt was reported that the Hisilicon Network Subsystem (HNS) driver\n implementation does not properly handle ethtool private flags. A\n local user could use this for denial of service or possibly have\n other impact.\n* [CVE-2017-18224](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18224)\nAlex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem omits the use of a\n semaphore and consequently has a race condition for access to the\n extent tree during read operations in DIRECT mode. A local user\n could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-18241](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18241)\nYunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly\n initialise its state if the noflush\\_merge mount option is used.\n A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option\n could use this to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-18257](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18257)\nIt was reported that the f2fs implementation is prone to an infinite\n loop caused by an integer overflow in the \\_\\_get\\_data\\_block()\n function. A local user can use this for denial of service via\n crafted use of the open and fallocate system calls with an\n FS\\_IOC\\_FIEMAP ioctl.\n* [CVE-2018-1065](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1065)\nThe syzkaller tool found a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the\n netfilter subsystem when handling certain malformed iptables\n rulesets. A local user with the CAP\\_NET\\_RAW or CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN\n capability (in any user namespace) could use this to cause a denial\n of service. Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default.\n* [CVE-2018-1066](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1066)\nDan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation\n would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid\n response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation. This could be used\n by a malicious server for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-1068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1068)\nThe syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of\n ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit\n kernel, a local user with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability (in any user\n namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly\n leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user\n namespaces by default.\n* [CVE-2018-1092](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1092)\nWen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would\n trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local user able\n to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of\n service.\n* [CVE-2018-1093](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1093)\nWen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger\n an out-of-bounds read in the ext4\\_valid\\_block\\_bitmap() function. A\n local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for\n denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-1108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1108)\nJann Horn reported that crng\\_ready() does not properly handle the\n crng\\_init variable states and the RNG could be treated as\n cryptographically safe too early after system boot.\n* [CVE-2018-5803](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5803)\nAlexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check\n the length of chunks to be created. A local or remote user could\n use this to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-7480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7480)\nHou Tao discovered a double-free flaw in the blkcg\\_init\\_queue()\n function in block/blk-cgroup.c. A local user could use this to cause\n a denial of service or have other impact.\n* [CVE-2018-7566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7566)\nFan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)\n sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations. This could\n lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free. A local user\n with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of\n service or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-7740](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7740)\nNic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation\n did not properly range-check the file offset. A local user with\n access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause\n a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-7757](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7757)\nJason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached\n SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a system with SAS devices\n could use this to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-7995](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7995)\nSeunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE\n (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to have\n any security impact.\n* [CVE-2018-8087](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8087)\nA memory leak flaw was found in the hwsim\\_new\\_radio\\_nl() function in\n the simulated radio testing tool driver for mac80211, allowing a\n local user to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-8781](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8781)\nEyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap\n operation did not properly range-check the file offset. A local\n user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to\n overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-8822](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8822)\nDr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client\n implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server. An\n ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or\n remote code execution in the client.\n* [CVE-2018-10323](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10323)\nWen Xu reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the\n xfs\\_bmapi\\_write() function triggered when mounting and operating a\n crafted xfs filesystem image. A local user able to mount arbitrary\n filesystems could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-1000199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000199)\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not\n sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings. Local users\n can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for\n privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other\n architectures.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.9.88-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux)\n\n\n",
