	"summary": "libssh - security update",
	"details": "\nPeter Winter-Smith of NCC Group discovered that libssh, a tiny C SSH\nlibrary, contains an authentication bypass vulnerability in the server\ncode. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw to successfully\nauthenticate without any credentials by presenting the server an\nSSH2\\_MSG\\_USERAUTH\\_SUCCESS message in place of the\nSSH2\\_MSG\\_USERAUTH\\_REQUEST message which the server would expect to\ninitiate authentication.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.7.3-2+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libssh please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libssh](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libssh)\n\n\n",
