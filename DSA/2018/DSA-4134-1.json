	"details": "\nBjorn Bosselmann discovered that the umount bash completion from\nutil-linux does not properly handle embedded shell commands in a\nmountpoint name. An attacker with rights to mount filesystems can take\nadvantage of this flaw for privilege escalation if a user (in particular\nroot) is tricked into using the umount completion while a specially\ncrafted mount is present.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.29.2-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your util-linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of util-linux please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/util-linux>\n\n\n",
