A remote attacker can\ntake advantage of this flaw to retrieve arbitrary files via a specially\ncrafted request, when 'enable-http-clone=1' (default) is not turned off.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1+git2.10.2-3+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cgit packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of cgit please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cgit>\n\n\n",
