A remote attacker can take\nadvantage of this flaw to cause a denial-of-service or, potentially the\nexecution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\np7zip, if a specially crafted shrinked ZIP archive is processed.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed\nin version 9.20.1~dfsg.1-4.1+deb8u3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 16.02+dfsg-3+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your p7zip packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of p7zip please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/p7zip>\n\n\n",
