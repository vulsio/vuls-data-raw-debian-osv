	"summary": "ant - security update",
	"details": "\nDanny Grander reported that the unzip and untar tasks in ant, a Java\nbased build tool like make, allow the extraction of files outside a\ntarget directory. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw by\nsubmitting a specially crafted Zip or Tar archive to an ant build to\noverwrite any file writable by the user running ant.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.9.9-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ant packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of ant please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ant>\n\n\n",
