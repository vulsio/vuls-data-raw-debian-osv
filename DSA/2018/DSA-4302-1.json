The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-16947](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16947)\nJeffrey Altman reported that the backup tape controller (butc)\n process does accept incoming RPCs but does not require (or allow\n for) authentication of those RPCs, allowing an unauthenticated\n attacker to perform volume operations with administrator\n credentials.\n* [CVE-2018-16948](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16948)\nMark Vitale reported that several RPC server routines do not fully\n initialize output variables, leaking memory contents (from both\n the stack and the heap) to the remote caller for\n otherwise-successful RPCs.\n* [CVE-2018-16949](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16949)\nMark Vitale reported that an unauthenticated attacker can consume\n large amounts of server memory and network bandwidth via\n specially crafted requests, resulting in denial of service to\n legitimate clients.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.20-2+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of openafs please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openafs](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openafs)\n\n\n",
