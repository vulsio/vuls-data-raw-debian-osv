	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga, a routing\ndaemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-5378](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5378)\nIt was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, does not\n properly bounds check data sent with a NOTIFY to a peer, if an\n attribute length is invalid. A configured BGP peer can take\n advantage of this bug to read memory from the bgpd process or cause\n a denial of service (daemon crash).\n\n\nhttps://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-0543.txt\n* [CVE-2018-5379](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5379)\nIt was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can double-free\n memory when processing certain forms of UPDATE message, containing\n cluster-list and/or unknown attributes, resulting in a denial of\n service (bgpd daemon crash).\n\n\nhttps://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-1114.txt\n* [CVE-2018-5380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5380)\nIt was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, does not\n properly handle internal BGP code-to-string conversion tables.\n\n\nhttps://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-1550.txt\n* [CVE-2018-5381](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5381)\nIt was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can enter an\n infinite loop if sent an invalid OPEN message by a configured peer.\n A configured peer can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial\n of service (bgpd daemon not responding to any other events; BGP\n sessions will drop and not be reestablished; unresponsive CLI\n interface).\n\n\nhttps://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-1975.txt\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.99.23.1-1+deb8u5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1.1-3+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of quagga please refer to its security\ntracker page at: [\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/quagga](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/quagga)\n\n\n",
