The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-6797](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6797)\nBrian Carpenter reported that a crafted regular expression\n could cause a heap buffer write overflow, with control over the\n bytes written.\n* [CVE-2018-6798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6798)\nNguyen Duc Manh reported that matching a crafted locale\n dependent regular expression can cause a heap-based buffer\n over-read and potentially information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2018-6913](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6913)\nGwanYeong Kim reported that 'pack()' could cause a heap buffer write\n overflow with a large item count.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 5.20.2-3+deb8u10. The oldstable distribution (jessie) update\ncontains only a fix for [CVE-2018-6913](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6913).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.24.1-3+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of perl please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/perl](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/perl)\n\n\n",
