	"details": "\nDaniel Bleichenbacher discovered a flaw in the OpenSSL cryptographic package\nthat could allow an attacker to generate a forged signature that OpenSSL\nwill accept as valid.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.7e-3sarge2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.8b-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages. Note that services\nlinking against the openssl shared libraries will need to be restarted.\nCommon examples of such services include most Mail Transport Agents, SSH\nservers, and web servers.\n\n\n",
