Due to technical problems with the security\nbuildd infrastructure this update lacks a build for the Sun Sparc\narchitecture. It will be released as soon as the problems are resolved.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 180-1.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpam-ldap package.\n\n\n",
