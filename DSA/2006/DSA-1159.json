	"details": "\nThe latest security updates of Mozilla Thunderbird introduced a\nregression that led to a dysfunctional attachment panel which warrants\na correction to fix this issue. For reference please find below the\noriginal advisory text:\n\n\n\n> \n> Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and\n> derived products such as Mozilla Thunderbird. The Common\n> Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\n> vulnerabilities:\n> \n> \n> * [CVE-2006-2779](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2779)\n> Mozilla team members discovered several crashes during testing of\n>  the browser engine showing evidence of memory corruption which may\n>  also lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The last bit of\n>  this problem will be corrected with the next update. You can\n>  prevent any trouble by disabling Javascript. [MFSA-2006-32]\n> * [CVE-2006-3805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3805)\n> The Javascript engine might allow remote attackers to execute\n>  arbitrary code. [MFSA-2006-50]\n> * [CVE-2006-3806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3806)\n> Multiple integer overflows in the Javascript engine might allow\n>  remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. [MFSA-2006-50]\n> * [CVE-2006-3807](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3807)\n> Specially crafted Javascript allows remote attackers to execute\n>  arbitrary code. [MFSA-2006-51]\n> * [CVE-2006-3808](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3808)\n> Remote Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) servers could execute code with elevated\n>  privileges via a specially crafted PAC script. [MFSA-2006-52]\n> * [CVE-2006-3809](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3809)\n> Scripts with the UniversalBrowserRead privilege could gain\n>  UniversalXPConnect privileges and possibly execute code or obtain\n>  sensitive data. [MFSA-2006-53]\n> * [CVE-2006-3810](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3810)\n> A cross-site scripting vulnerability allows remote attackers to\n>  inject arbitrary web script or HTML. [MFSA-2006-54]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-2.sarge1.0.8b.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.5.0.5-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mozilla-thunderbird package.\n\n\n",
