	"summary": "lynx-cur - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in lynx, the popular\ntext-mode WWW browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nProject identifies the following vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CVE-2004-1617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-1617)\nMichal Zalewski discovered that lynx is not able to grok invalid\n HTML including a TEXTAREA tag with a large COLS value and a large\n tag name in an element that is not terminated, and loops forever\n trying to render the broken HTML.\n* [CVE-2005-3120](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3120)\nUlf HĂ¤rnhammar discovered a buffer overflow that can be remotely\n exploited. During the handling of Asian characters when connecting\n to an NNTP server lynx can be tricked to write past the boundary\n of a buffer which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.8.5-2.5woody1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.8.6-9sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lynx-cur package.\n\n\n",
