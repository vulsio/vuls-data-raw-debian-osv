The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2005-4574](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4574)\nIt was discovered that the MIME multipart dissector is vulnerable to\n denial of service caused by an off-by-one overflow.\n* [CVE-2006-4805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4805)\nIt was discovered that the XOT dissector is vulnerable to denial\n of service caused by memory corruption.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.10.10-2sarge9. Due to technical problems with the security\nbuildd infrastructure this update lacks builds for the hppa and sparc\narchitecture. They will be released as soon as the problems are resolved.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.\n\n\n",
