	"summary": "kernel-source-2.4.27 - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in the Linux\nkernel which may lead to a denial of service or even the execution of\narbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2005-4798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4798)\nA buffer overflow in NFS readlink handling allows a malicious\n remote server to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2006-2935](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2935)\nDiego Calleja Garcia discovered a buffer overflow in the DVD\n handling code that could be exploited by a specially crafted DVD\n USB storage device to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-1528](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1528)\nA bug in the SCSI driver allows a local user to cause a denial of\n service.\n* [CVE-2006-2444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2444)\nPatrick McHardy discovered a bug in the SNMP NAT helper that\n allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2006-2446](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2446)\nA race condition in the socket buffer handling allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2006-3745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3745)\nWei Wang discovered a bug in the SCTP implementation that allows\n local users to cause a denial of service and possibly gain root\n privileges.\n* [CVE-2006-4535](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4535)\nDavid Miller reported a problem with the fix for [CVE-2006-3745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3745)\n that allows local users to crash the system via an SCTP\n socket with a certain SO\\_LINGER value.\n\n\nThe following matrix explains which kernel version for which\narchitecture fixes the problem mentioned above:\n\n\n\n\n|  | stable (sarge) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Source | 2.4.27-10sarge4 |\n| Alpha architecture | 2.4.27-10sarge4 |\n| ARM architecture | 2.4.27-2sarge4 |\n| Intel IA-32 architecture | 2.4.27-10sarge4 |\n| Intel IA-64 architecture | 2.4.27-10sarge4 |\n| Motorola 680x0 architecture | 2.4.27-3sarge4 |\n| MIPS architectures | 2.4.27-10.sarge4.040815-1 |\n| PowerPC architecture | 2.4.27-10sarge4 |\n| IBM S/390 | 2.4.27-2sarge4 |\n| Sun Sparc architecture | 2.4.27-9sarge4 |\n| FAI | 1.9.1sarge4 |\n| mindi-kernel | 2.4.27-2sarge3 |\n| kernel-image-speakup-i386 | 2.4.27-1.1sarge3 |\n| systemimager | 3.2.3-6sarge3 |\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems won't be fixed\nanymore in the 2.4 kernel series.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel package and reboot the\nmachine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source\npackage, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.\n\n\n",
