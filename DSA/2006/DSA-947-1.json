	"summary": "clamav - heap overflow",
	"details": "\nA heap overflow has been discovered in ClamAV, a virus scanner, which\ncould allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending a carefully\ncrafted UPX-encoded executable to a system running ClamAV. In addition,\nother potential overflows have been corrected.\n\n\nPackages for the ARM architecture were not available when DSA 947-1 was\nreleased; these packages are now available. Also, DSA 947-1 incorrectly\nidentified the package version which corrected these issues in the\nunstable distribution (sid).\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not include ClamAV.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.84-2.sarge.7.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.88-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav package immediately.\n\n\n",
