	"details": "\nThe former update caused temporary files to be created in the current\nworking directory due to a wrong function argument. This update will\ncreate temporary files in the users home directory if HOME is set or\nin the common temporary directory otherwise, usually /tmp. For\ncompleteness below is a copy of the original advisory text:\n\n\n\n> \n> Niko Tyni discovered that the Mail::Audit module, a Perl library for\n> creating simple mail filters, logs to a temporary file with a\n> predictable filename in an insecure fashion when logging is turned on,\n> which is not the case by default.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0-4woody3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.1-5sarge4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.1-5.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libmail-audit-perl package.\n\n\n",
