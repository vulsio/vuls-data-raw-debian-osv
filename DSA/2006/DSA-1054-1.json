The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-2024](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2024)\nMultiple vulnerabilities allow attackers to cause a denial of\n service.\n* [CVE-2006-2025](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2025)\nAn integer overflow allows attackers to cause a denial of service\n and possibly execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-2026](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2026)\nA double-free vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of\n service and possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.5.5-7woody1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.7.2-3sarge1.\n\n\nThe unstable distribution (sid) is not vulnerable to these problems.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libtiff packages.\n\n\n",
