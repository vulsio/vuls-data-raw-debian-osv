The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-4226](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4226)\nMichal Prokopiuk discovered that remote authenticated users are\n permitted to create and access a database if the lowercase\n spelling is the same as one they have been granted access to.\n* [CVE-2006-4380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4380)\nBeat Vontobel discovered that certain queries replicated to a\n slave could crash the client and thus terminate the replication.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.1.11a-4sarge7. Version 4.0 is not affected by these\nproblems.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.0.24-3. The replication problem only exists in version 4.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql-server-4.1 package.\n\n\n",
