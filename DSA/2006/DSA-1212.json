The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-4924](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4924)\nThe sshd support for ssh protocol version 1 does not properly\n handle duplicate incoming blocks. This could allow a remote\n attacker to cause sshd to consume significant CPU resources\n leading to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2006-5051](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5051)\nA signal handler race condition could potentially allow a remote\n attacker to crash sshd and could theoretically lead to the\n ability to execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:3.8.1p1-8.sarge.6.\n\n\nFor the unstable and testing distributions, these problems have been\nfixed in version 1:4.3p2-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssh package.\n\n\n",
