	"summary": "openssl096 - cryptographic weakness",
	"details": "\nDaniel Bleichenbacher discovered a flaw in the OpenSSL cryptographic package\nthat could allow an attacker to generate a forged signature that OpenSSL\nwill accept as valid.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.6m-1sarge2.\n\n\nThis package exists only for compatibility with older software, and is\nnot present in the unstable or testing branches of Debian.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages. Note that services\nlinking against the openssl shared libraries will need to be restarted.\nCommon examples of such services include most Mail Transport Agents, SSH\nservers, and web servers.\n\n\n",
