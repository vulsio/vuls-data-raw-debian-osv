The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2005-1391](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-1391):\n Overly long HTTP Host: headers may trigger a buffer overflow in the\n add\\_port() function, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary\n code.\n* [CVE-2005-3751](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3751):\n HTTP requests with conflicting Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding\n headers could lead to HTTP Request Smuggling Attack, which can be\n exploited to bypass packet filters or poison web caches.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pound packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.8.2-1sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pound package.\n\n\n",
