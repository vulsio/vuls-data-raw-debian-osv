The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-4334](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4334)\nA null pointer dereference may lead to denial of service if gzip is\n used in an automated manner.\n* [CVE-2006-4335](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4335)\nMissing boundary checks may lead to stack modification, allowing\n execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-4336](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4336)\nA buffer underflow in the pack support code may lead to execution of\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-4337](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4337)\nA buffer underflow in the LZH support code may lead to execution of\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-4338](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4338)\nAn infinite loop may lead to denial of service if gzip is used in\n an automated manner.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.5-10sarge2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.5-15.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gzip package.\n\n\n",
