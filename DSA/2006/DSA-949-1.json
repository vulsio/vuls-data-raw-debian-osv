The program\nexecutes commands insecurely when saving or loading games which can\nallow local attackers to gain group games privileges.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.0beta23-2woody2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.0beta26-4sarge0.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.0beta26-7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your crawl package.\n\n\n",
