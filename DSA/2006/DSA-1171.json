The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-4333](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4333)\nIt was discovered that the Q.2391 dissector is vulnerable to denial\n of service caused by memory exhaustion.\n* [CVE-2005-3241](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3241)\nIt was discovered that the FC-FCS, RSVP and ISIS-LSP dissectors are\n vulnerable to denial of service caused by memory exhaustion.\n* [CVE-2005-3242](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3242)\nIt was discovered that the IrDA and SMB dissectors are vulnerable to\n denial of service caused by memory corruption.\n* [CVE-2005-3243](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3243)\nIt was discovered that the SLIMP3 and AgentX dissectors are vulnerable\n to code injection caused by buffer overflows.\n* [CVE-2005-3244](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3244)\nIt was discovered that the BER dissector is vulnerable to denial of\n service caused by an infinite loop.\n* [CVE-2005-3246](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3246)\nIt was discovered that the NCP and RTnet dissectors are vulnerable to\n denial of service caused by a null pointer dereference.\n* [CVE-2005-3248](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3248)\nIt was discovered that the X11 dissector is vulnerable to denial of service\n caused by a division through zero.\n\n\nThis update also fixes a 64 bit-specific regression in the ASN.1 decoder, which\nwas introduced in a previous DSA.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.10.10-2sarge8.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.99.2-5.1 of wireshark, the network sniffer formerly known as\nethereal.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.\n\n\n",
