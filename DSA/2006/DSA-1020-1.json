	"summary": "flex - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nChris Moore discovered that flex, a scanner generator, generates code,\nwhich allocates insufficient memory, if the grammar contains REJECT\nstatements or trailing context rules. This may lead to a buffer overflow\nand the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nIf you use code, which is derived from a vulnerable lex grammar in\nan untrusted environment you need to regenerate your scanner with the\nfixed version of flex.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.5.31-31sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.5.33-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your flex package.\n\n\n",
