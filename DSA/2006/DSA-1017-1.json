The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2004-1017](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-1017)\nMultiple overflows exist in the io\\_edgeport driver which might be usable\n as a denial of service attack vector.\n* [CVE-2005-0124](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0124)\nBryan Fulton reported a bounds checking bug in the coda\\_pioctl function\n which may allow local users to execute arbitrary code or trigger a denial\n of service attack.\n* [CVE-2005-0449](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0449)\nAn error in the skb\\_checksum\\_help() function from the netfilter framework\n has been discovered that allows the bypass of packet filter rules or\n a denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2005-2457](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2457)\nTim Yamin discovered that insufficient input validation in the zisofs driver\n for compressed ISO file systems allows a denial of service attack through\n maliciously crafted ISO images.\n* [CVE-2005-2490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2490)\nA buffer overflow in the sendmsg() function allows local users to execute\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2005-2555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2555)\nHerbert Xu discovered that the setsockopt() function was not restricted to\n users/processes with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability. This allows attackers to\n manipulate IPSEC policies or initiate a denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2005-2709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2709)\nAl Viro discovered a race condition in the /proc handling of network devices.\n A (local) attacker could exploit the stale reference after interface shutdown\n to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code in kernel mode.\n* [CVE-2005-2800](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2800)\nJan Blunck discovered that repeated failed reads of /proc/scsi/sg/devices\n leak memory, which allows a denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2005-2973](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2973)\nTetsuo Handa discovered that the udp\\_v6\\_get\\_port() function from the IPv6 code\n can be forced into an endless loop, which allows a denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2005-3044](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3044)\nVasiliy Averin discovered that the reference counters from sockfd\\_put() and \n fput() can be forced into overlapping, which allows a denial of service attack\n through a null pointer dereference.\n* [CVE-2005-3053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3053)\nEric Dumazet discovered that the set\\_mempolicy() system call accepts a negative\n value for its first argument, which triggers a BUG() assert. This allows a\n denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2005-3055](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3055)\nHarald Welte discovered that if a process issues a USB Request Block (URB)\n to a device and terminates before the URB completes, a stale pointer\n would be dereferenced. This could be used to trigger a denial of service\n attack.\n* [CVE-2005-3180](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3180)\nPavel Roskin discovered that the driver for Orinoco wireless cards clears\n its buffers insufficiently.

allows a denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2005-3783](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3783)\nThe ptrace code using CLONE\\_THREAD didn't use the thread group ID to\n determine whether the caller is attaching to itself, which allows a denial\n of service attack.\n* [CVE-2005-3784](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3784)\nThe auto-reaping of child processes functionality included ptraced-attached\n processes, which allows denial of service through dangling references.\n* [CVE-2005-3806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3806)\nYen Zheng discovered that the IPv6 flow label code modified an incorrect variable,\n which could lead to memory corruption and denial of service.\n* [CVE-2005-3847](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3847)\nIt was discovered that a threaded real-time process, which is currently dumping\n core can be forced into a dead-lock situation by sending it a SIGKILL signal,\n which allows a denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2005-3848](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3848)\nOllie Wild discovered a memory leak in the icmp\\_push\\_reply() function, which\n allows denial of service through memory consumption.\n* [CVE-2005-3857](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3857)\nChris Wright discovered that excessive allocation of broken file lock leases\n in the VFS layer can exhaust memory and fill up the system logging, which allows\n denial of service.\n* [CVE-2005-3858](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3858)\nPatrick McHardy discovered a memory leak in the ip6\\_input\\_finish() function from\n the IPv6 code, which allows denial of service.\n* [CVE-2005-4605](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4605)\nKarl Janmar discovered that a signedness error in the procfs code can be exploited\n to read kernel memory, which may disclose sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2005-4618](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4618)\nYi Ying discovered that sysctl does not properly enforce the size of a buffer, which\n allows a denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2006-0095](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0095)\nStefan Rompf discovered that dm\\_crypt does not clear an internal struct before freeing\n it, which might disclose sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2006-0096](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0096)\nIt was discovered that the SDLA driver's capability checks were too lax\n for firmware upgrades.\n* [CVE-2006-0482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0482)\nLudovic Courtes discovered that get\\_compat\\_timespec() performs insufficient input\n sanitizing, which allows a local denial of service attack.\n* [CVE-2006-1066](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1066)\nIt was discovered that ptrace() on the ia64 architecture allows a local denial of\n service attack, when preemption is enabled.\n\n\nThe following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture\nfix the problems mentioned above:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 3.1 (sarge) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Source  | 2.6.8-16sarge2 |\n| Alpha architecture  | 2.6.8-16sarge2 |\n| AMD64 architecture  | 2.6.8-16sarge2 |\n| HP Precision architecture  | 2.6.8-6sarge2 |\n| Intel IA-32 architecture  | 2.6.8-16sarge2 |\n| Intel IA-64 architecture  | 2.6.8-14sarge2 |\n| Motorola 680x0 architecture | 2.6.8-4sarge2 |\n| PowerPC architecture  | 2.6.8-12sarge2 |\n| IBM S/390 architecture  | 2.6.8-5sarge2 |\n| Sun Sparc architecture  | 2.6.8-15sarge2 |\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 3.1 (sarge) |\n| --- | --- |\n| kernel-latest-2.6-alpha  | 101sarge1 |\n| kernel-latest-2.6-amd64  | 103sarge1 |\n| kernel-latest-2.6-hppa  | 2.6.8-1sarge1 |\n| kernel-latest-2.6-sparc  | 101sarge1 |\n| kernel-latest-2.6-i386  | 101sarge1 |\n| kernel-latest-powerpc  | 102sarge1 |\n| fai-kernels  | 1.9.1sarge1 |\n|

and reboot\nthe machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source\npackage, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.\n\n\nThis update introduces a change in the kernel's binary interface, the affected\nkernel packages inside Debian have been rebuilt, if you're running local addons\nyou'll need to rebuild these as well. Due to the change in the package\nname you need to use apt-get dist-upgrade to update your system.\n\n\n",
