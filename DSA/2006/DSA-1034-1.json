The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-1260](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1260)\nNull characters in the URL parameter bypass a sanity check, which\n allowed remote attackers to read arbitrary files, which allowed\n information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2006-1491](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1491)\nUser input in the help viewer was passed unsanitised to the eval()\n function, which allowed injection of arbitrary web code.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain horde2 packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.8-1sarge2.\n\n\nThe unstable distribution (sid) does no longer contain horde2 packages.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your horde2 package.\n\n\n",
