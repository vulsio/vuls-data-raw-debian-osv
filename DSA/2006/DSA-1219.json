Note that binary packages for the mipsel\narchitecture are not currently available due to technical problems with\nthe build host. These packages will be made available as soon as\npossible.\n\n\nFor unstable (sid) and the upcoming stable release (etch), these\nproblems have been fixed in version 4.8.dfsg.1-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your texinfo package.\n\n\n",
