	"details": "\n The original update lacked recompiled ALSA modules against the new kernel\nABI. Furthermore, kernel-latest-2.4-sparc now correctly depends on the\nupdated packages. For completeness we're providing the original problem description:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux\n> kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary\n> code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\n> following problems:\n> \n> \n> * [CVE-2004-0887](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-0887)\n> Martin Schwidefsky discovered that the privileged instruction SACF (Set\n>  Address Space Control Fast) on the S/390 platform is not handled properly, \n>  allowing for a local user to gain root privileges.\n> * [CVE-2004-1058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-1058)\n> A race condition allows for a local user to read the environment variables\n>  of another process that is still spawning through /proc/.../cmdline.\n> * [CVE-2004-2607](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2607)\n> A numeric casting discrepancy in sdla\\_xfer allows local users to read\n>  portions of kernel memory via a large len argument which is received as an\n>  int but cast to a short, preventing read loop from filling a buffer.\n> * [CVE-2005-0449](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0449)\n> An error in the skb\\_checksum\\_help() function from the netfilter framework\n>  has been discovered that allows the bypass of packet filter rules or\n>  a denial of service attack.\n> * [CVE-2005-1761](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-1761)\n> A vulnerability in the ptrace subsystem of the IA-64 architecture can \n>  allow local attackers to overwrite kernel memory and crash the kernel.\n> * [CVE-2005-2457](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2457)\n> Tim Yamin discovered that insufficient input validation in the compressed\n>  ISO file system (zisofs) allows a denial of service attack through\n>  maliciously crafted ISO images.\n> * [CVE-2005-2555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2555)\n> Herbert Xu discovered that the setsockopt() function was not restricted to\n>  users/processes with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability. This allows attackers to\n>  manipulate IPSEC policies or initiate a denial of service attack.\n> * [CVE-2005-2709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2709)\n> Al Viro discovered a race condition in the /proc handling of network devices.\n>  A (local) attacker could exploit the stale reference after interface shutdown\n>  to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code in kernel mode.\n> * [CVE-2005-2973](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2973)\n> Tetsuo Handa discovered that the udp\\_v6\\_get\\_port() function from the IPv6 code\n>  can be forced into an endless loop, which allows a denial of service attack.\n> * [CVE-2005-3257](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3257)\n> Rudolf Polzer discovered that the kernel improperly restricts access to the\n>  KDSKBSENT ioctl, which can possibly lead to privilege escalation.\n> * [CVE-2005-3783](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3783)\n> The ptrace code using CLONE\\_THREAD didn't use the thread group ID to\n>  determine whether the caller is attaching to itself, which allows a denial\n>  of service attack.\n> * [CVE-2005-3806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3806)\n> Yen Zheng discovered that the IPv6 flow label code modified an incorrect variable,\n>  which could lead to memory corruption and denial of service.\n> * [CVE-2005-3848](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3848)\n> Ollie Wild discovered a memory leak in the icmp\\_push\\_reply() function, which\n>  allows denial of service through memory consumption.\n> * [CVE-2005-3857](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3857)\n> Chris Wright discovered that excessive allocation of broken file lock leases\n>  in the VFS layer can exhaust memory and fill up the system logging, which allows\n>  denial of service.\n> * [CVE-2005-3858](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3858)\n> Patrick McHardy discovered a memory leak in the ip6\\_input\\_finish() function from\n>  the IPv6 code, which allows denial of service.\n> * [CVE-2005-4618](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4618)\n> Yi Ying discovered that sysctl does not properly enforce the size of a\n>  buffer, which allows a denial of service attack.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture\nfix the problems mentioned above:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 3.1 (sarge) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Source  | 2.4.27-10sarge2 |\n| Alpha architecture  | 2.4.27-10sarge2 |\n| ARM architecture  | 2.4.27-2sarge2 |\n| Intel IA-32 architecture  | 2.4.27-10sarge2 |\n| Intel IA-64 architecture  | 2.4.27-10sarge2 |\n| Motorola 680x0 architecture  | 2.4.27-3sarge2 |\n| Big endian MIPS architecture  | 2.4.27-10.sarge1.040815-2 |\n| Little endian MIPS architecture | 2.4.27-10.sarge1.040815-2 |\n| PowerPC architecture  | 2.4.27-10sarge2 |\n| IBM S/390 architecture  | 2.4.27-2sarge2 |\n| Sun Sparc architecture  | 2.4.27-9sarge2 |\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 3.1 (sarge) |\n| --- | --- |\n| kernel-latest-2.4-alpha  | 101sarge1 |\n| kernel-latest-2.4-i386  | 101sarge1 |\n| kernel-latest-2.4-s390  | 2.4.27-1sarge1 |\n| kernel-latest-2.4-sparc  | 42sarge1 |\n| kernel-latest-powerpc  | 102sarge1 |\n| fai-kernels  | 1.9.1sarge1 |\n| i2c  | 1:2.9.1-1sarge1 |\n| kernel-image-speakup-i386  | 2.4.27-1.1sasrge1 |\n| lm-sensors  | 1:2.9.1-1sarge3 |\n| mindi-kernel  | 2.4.27-2sarge1 |\n| pcmcia-modules-2.4.27-i386 | 3.2.5+2sarge1 |\n| systemimager  | 3.2.3-6sarge1 |\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot\nthe machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source\npackage, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.\n\n\nThis update introduces a change in the kernel's binary interface, the affected\nkernel packages inside Debian have been rebuilt, if you're running local addons\nyou'll need to rebuild these as well.\n\n\n",
