The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2005-3146](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3146)\nStorebackup creates a temporary file predictably, which can be\n exploited to overwrite arbitrary files on the system with a symlink\n attack.\n* [CVE-2005-3147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3147)\nThe backup root directory wasn't created with fixed permissions, which may lead to\n inproper permissions if the umask is too lax.\n* [CVE-2005-3148](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3148)\nThe user and group rights of symlinks are set incorrectly when making\n or restoring a backup, which may leak sensitive data.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain storebackup packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.18.4-2sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.19-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your storebackup package.\n\n\n",
