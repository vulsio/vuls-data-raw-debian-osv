The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-1614](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1614)\nDamian Put discovered an integer overflow in the PE header parser.\n This is only exploitable if the ArchiveMaxFileSize option is disabled.\n* [CVE-2006-1615](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1615)\nFormat string vulnerabilities in the logging code have been discovered,\n which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-1630](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1630)\nDavid Luyer discovered, that ClamAV can be tricked into an invalid\n memory access in the cli\\_bitset\\_set() function, which may lead to\n a denial of service.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain clamav packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.84-2.sarge.8.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.88.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav package.\n\n\n",
