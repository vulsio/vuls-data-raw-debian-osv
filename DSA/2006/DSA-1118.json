	"details": "\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-1942](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1942)\nEric Foley discovered that a user can be tricked to expose a local\n file to a remote attacker by displaying a local file as image in\n connection with other vulnerabilities. [MFSA-2006-39]\n* [CVE-2006-2775](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2775)\nXUL attributes are associated with the wrong URL under certain\n circumstances, which might allow remote attackers to bypass\n restrictions. [MFSA-2006-35]\n* [CVE-2006-2776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2776)\nPaul Nickerson discovered that content-defined setters on an\n object prototype were getting called by privileged user interface\n code, and moz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 demonstrated that the higher privilege\n level could be passed along to the content-defined attack code.\n [MFSA-2006-37]\n* [CVE-2006-2777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2777)\nA vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code\n and create notifications that are executed in a privileged\n context. [MFSA-2006-43]\n* [CVE-2006-2778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2778)\nMikolaj Habryn discovered a buffer overflow in the crypto.signText function\n that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain\n optional Certificate Authority name arguments. [MFSA-2006-38]\n* [CVE-2006-2779](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2779)\nMozilla team members discovered several crashes during testing of\n the browser engine showing evidence of memory corruption which may\n also lead to the execution of arbitrary code. This problem has\n only partially been corrected. [MFSA-2006-32]\n* [CVE-2006-2780](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2780)\nAn integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service and may permit the execution of arbitrary code.\n [MFSA-2006-32]\n* [CVE-2006-2781](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2781)\nMasatoshi Kimura discovered a double-free vulnerability that\n allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly\n execute arbitrary code via a VCard. [MFSA-2006-40]\n* [CVE-2006-2782](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2782)\nChuck McAuley discovered that a text input box can be pre-filled\n with a filename and then turned into a file-upload control,\n allowing a malicious website to steal any local file whose name\n they can guess. [MFSA-2006-41, MFSA-2006-23, [CVE-2006-1729](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1729)]\n* [CVE-2006-2783](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2783)\nMasatoshi Kimura discovered that the Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM)\n is stripped from UTF-8 pages during the conversion to Unicode\n before the parser sees the web page, which allows remote attackers\n to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. [MFSA-2006-42]\n* [CVE-2006-2784](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2784)\nPaul Nickerson discovered that the fix for [CVE-2005-0752](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0752) can be\n bypassed using nested javascript: URLs, allowing the attacker to\n execute privileged code. [MFSA-2005-34, MFSA-2006-36]\n* [CVE-2006-2785](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2785)\nPaul Nickerson demonstrated that if an attacker could convince a\n user to right-click on a broken image and choose View Image from\n the context menu then he could get JavaScript to\n run. [MFSA-2006-34]\n* [CVE-2006-2786](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2786)\nKazuho Oku discovered that Mozilla's lenient handling of HTTP\n header syntax may allow remote attackers to trick the browser to\n interpret certain responses as if they were responses from two\n different sites. [MFSA-2006-33]\n* [CVE-2006-2787](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2787)\nThe Mozilla researcher moz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered that JavaScript\n run via EvalInSandbox can escape the sandbox and gain elevated\n privilege. [MFSA-2006-31]\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.7.8-1sarge7.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.7.13-0.3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Mozilla packages.\n\n\n",
