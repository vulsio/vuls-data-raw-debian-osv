To fix this problem, python-docutils\nneeds to be updated as well.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.1-3sarge5 of trac and version 0.3.7-2sarge1 of\npython-docutils.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your trac and python-docutils packages.\n\n\n",
