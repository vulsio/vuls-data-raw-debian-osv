	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in libphp-adodb, the 'adodb'\ndatabase abstraction layer for PHP. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-0146](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0146)\nAndreas Sandblad discovered that improper user input sanitisation\n results in a potential remote SQL injection vulnerability enabling\n an attacker to compromise applications, access or modify data, or\n exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.\n This requires the MySQL root password to be empty. It is fixed by\n limiting access to the script in question.\n* [CVE-2006-0147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0147)\nA dynamic code evaluation vulnerability allows remote attackers to\n execute arbitrary PHP functions via the 'do' parameter.\n* [CVE-2006-0410](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0410)\nAndy Staudacher discovered an SQL injection vulnerability due to\n insufficient input sanitising that allows remote attackers to\n execute arbitrary SQL commands.\n* [CVE-2006-0806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0806)\nGulfTech Security Research discovered multiple cross-site\n scripting vulnerabilities due to improper user-supplied input\n sanitisation. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to\n cause arbitrary scripts to be executed in the browser of an\n unsuspecting user's machine, or result in the theft of\n cookie-based authentication credentials.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.51-1.2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.52-1sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.72-0.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libphp-adodb package.\n\n\n",
