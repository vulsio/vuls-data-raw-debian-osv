	"summary": "isakmpd",
	"details": "\nA flaw has been found in isakmpd, OpenBSD's implementation of the\nInternet Key Exchange protocol, that caused Security Associations to be\ncreated with a replay window of 0 when isakmpd was acting as the\nresponder during SA negotiation. This could allow an attacker to\nre-inject sniffed IPsec packets, which would not be checked against the\nreplay counter.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 20041012-1sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 20041012-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your isakmpd package.\n\n\n",
