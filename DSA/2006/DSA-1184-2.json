	"details": "\nThis advisory covers the S/390 components of the recent security\nupdate for the Linux 2.6.8 kernel that were missing due to technical\nproblems. For reference, please see the text of the original advisory.\n\n\n\n> \n> Several security related problems have been discovered in the Linux\n> kernel which may lead to a denial of service or even the execution of\n> arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n> identifies the following problems:\n> \n> \n> * [CVE-2004-2660](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2660)\n> Toshihiro Iwamoto discovered a memory leak in the handling of\n>  direct I/O writes that allows local users to cause a denial of\n>  service.\n> * [CVE-2005-4798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4798)\n> A buffer overflow in NFS readlink handling allows a malicious\n>  remote server to cause a denial of service.\n> * [CVE-2006-1052](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1052)\n> Stephen Smalley discovered a bug in the SELinux ptrace handling\n>  that allows local users with ptrace permissions to change the\n>  tracer SID to the SID of another process.\n> * [CVE-2006-1343](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1343)\n> Pavel Kankovsky discovered an information leak in the getsockopt\n>  system call which can be exploited by a local program to leak\n>  potentially sensitive memory to userspace.\n> * [CVE-2006-1528](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1528)\n> Douglas Gilbert reported a bug in the sg driver that allows local\n>  users to cause a denial of service by performing direct I/O\n>  transfers from the sg driver to memory mapped I/O space.\n> * [CVE-2006-1855](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1855)\n> Mattia Belletti noticed that certain debugging code left in the\n>  process management code could be exploited by a local attacker to\n>  cause a denial of service.\n> * [CVE-2006-1856](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1856)\n> Kostik Belousov discovered a missing LSM file\\_permission check in\n>  the readv and writev functions which might allow attackers to\n>  bypass intended access restrictions.\n> * [CVE-2006-2444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2444)\n> Patrick McHardy discovered a bug in the SNMP NAT helper that\n>  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service.\n> * [CVE-2006-2446](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2446)\n> A race condition in the socket buffer handling allows remote\n>  attackers to cause a denial of service.\n> * [CVE-2006-2935](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2935)\n> Diego Calleja Garcia discovered a buffer overflow in the DVD\n>  handling code that could be exploited by a specially crafted DVD\n>  USB storage device to execute arbitrary code.\n> * [CVE-2006-2936](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2936)\n> A bug in the serial USB driver has been discovered that could be\n>  exploited by a custom made USB serial adapter to consume arbitrary\n>  amounts of memory.\n> * [CVE-2006-3468](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3468)\n> James McKenzie discovered a denial of service vulnerability in the\n>  NFS driver. When exporting an ext3 file system over NFS, a remote\n>  attacker could exploit this to trigger a file system panic by\n>  sending a specially crafted UDP packet.\n> * [CVE-2006-3745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3745)\n> Wei Wang discovered a bug in the SCTP implementation that allows\n>  local users to cause a denial of service and possibly gain root\n>  privileges.\n> * [CVE-2006-4093](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4093)\n> Olof Johansson discovered that the kernel does not disable the HID0\n>  bit on PowerPC 970 processors which could be exploited by a local\n>  attacker to cause a denial of service.\n> * [CVE-2006-4145](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4145)\n> A bug in the Universal Disk Format (UDF) filesystem driver could\n>  be exploited by a local user to cause a denial of service.\n> * [CVE-2006-4535](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4535)\n> David Miller reported a problem with the fix for [CVE-2006-3745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3745)\n>  that allows local users to crash the system via an SCTP\n>  socket with a certain SO\\_LINGER value.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe following matrix explains which kernel version for which\narchitecture fixes the problem mentioned above:\n\n\n\n\n|  | stable (sarge) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Source | 2.6.8-16sarge5 |\n| Alpha architecture | 2.6.8-16sarge5 |\n| AMD64 architecture | 2.6.8-16sarge5 |\n| HP Precision architecture | 2.6.8-6sarge5 |\n| Intel IA-32 architecture | 2.6.8-16sarge5 |\n| Intel IA-64 architecture | 2.6.8-14sarge5 |\n| Motorola 680x0 architecture | 2.6.8-4sarge5 |\n| PowerPC architecture | 2.6.8-12sarge5 |\n| IBM S/390 | 2.6.8-5sarge5 |\n| Sun Sparc architecture | 2.6.8-15sarge5 |\n| FAI | 1.9.1sarge4 |\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6.18-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel package and reboot the\nmachine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source\npackage, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.\n\n\n",
