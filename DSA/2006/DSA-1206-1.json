The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2005-3353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3353)\nTim Starling discovered that missing input sanitising in the EXIF\n module could lead to denial of service.\n* [CVE-2006-3017](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3017)\nStefan Esser discovered a security-critical programming error in the\n hashtable implementation of the internal Zend engine.\n* [CVE-2006-4482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4482)\nIt was discovered that str\\_repeat() and wordwrap() functions perform\n insufficient checks for buffer boundaries on 64 bit systems, which\n might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-5465](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5465)\nStefan Esser discovered a buffer overflow in the htmlspecialchars()\n and htmlentities(), which might lead to the execution of arbitrary\n code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4:4.3.10-18. Builds for hppa and m68k will be provided later\nonce they are available.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4:4.4.4-4 of php4 and version 5.1.6-6 of php5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php4 packages.\n\n\n",
