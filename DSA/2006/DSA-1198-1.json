Wiley Sittler discovered that the repr() of the Python \ninterpreter allocates insufficient memory when parsing UCS-4 Unicode\nstrings, which might lead to execution of arbitrary code through\na buffer overflow.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.5-3sarge2. Due to build problems this update lacks fixed\npackages for the Alpha and Sparc architectures. Once they are sorted\nout, fixed binaries will be released.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.5-16.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Python 2.3 packages.\n\n\n",
