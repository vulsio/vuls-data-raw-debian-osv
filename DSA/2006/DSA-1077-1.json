The\nsame code is present in lynx-ssl.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.8.4.1b-3.3.\n\n\nThe stable distribution (sarge) does not contain lynx-ssl packages\nanymore.\n\n\nThe unstable distribution (sid) does not contain lynx-ssl packages\nanymore.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lynx-ssl package.\n\n\n",
