	"summary": "sudo - missing input sanitising",
	"details": "\nThe former correction to vulnerabilities in the sudo package worked\nfine but were too strict for some environments. Therefore we have\nreviewed the changes again and allowed some environment variables to\ngo back into the privileged execution environment. Hence, this\nupdate.\n\n\nThe configuration option \"env\\_reset\" is now activated by default.\nIt will preserve only the environment variables HOME, LOGNAME, PATH,\nSHELL, TERM, DISPLAY, XAUTHORITY, XAUTHORIZATION, LANG, LANGUAGE,\nLC\\_\\*, and USER in addition to the separate SUDO\\_\\* variables.\n\n\nFor completeness please find below the original advisory text:\n\n\n\n> \n> It has been discovered that sudo, a privileged program, that provides\n> limited super user privileges to specific users, passes several\n> environment variables to the program that runs with elevated\n> privileges. In the case of include paths (e.g. for Perl, Python, Ruby\n> or other scripting languages) this can cause arbitrary code to be\n> executed as privileged user if the attacker points to a manipulated\n> version of a system library.\n> \n> \n> This update alters the former behaviour of sudo and limits the number\n> of supported environment variables to LC\\_\\*, LANG, LANGUAGE and TERM.\n> Additional variables are only passed through when set as env\\_check in\n> /etc/sudoers, which might be required for some scripts to continue to\n> work.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.6-1.6.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.8p7-1.4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) the same behaviour will be\nimplemented soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo package. For unstable\n\"Defaults = env\\_reset\" need to be added to /etc/sudoers manually.\n\n\n",
