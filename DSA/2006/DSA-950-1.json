	"details": "\n\"infamous41md\" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer\noverflows in xpdf which are also present in CUPS, the Common UNIX\nPrinting System, and which can lead to a denial of service by crashing\nthe application or possibly to the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1.14-5woody14.\n\n\nCUPS doesn't use the xpdf source anymore since 1.1.22-7, when it switched\nto using xpdf-utils for PDF processing.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your CUPS packages.\n\n\n",
