	"details": "\nSeveral encoding problems have been discovered in PostgreSQL, a\npopular SQL database. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-2313](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2313)\nAkio Ishida and Yasuo Ohgaki discovered a weakness in the handling\n of invalidly-encoded multibyte text data which could allow an\n attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.\n* [CVE-2006-2314](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2314)\nA similar problem exists in client-side encodings (such as SJIS,\n BIG5, GBK, GB18030, and UHC) which contain valid multibyte\n characters that end with the backslash character. An attacker\n could supply a specially crafted byte sequence that is able to\n inject arbitrary SQL commands.\n\n\nThis issue does not affect you if you only use single-byte (like\n SQL\\_ASCII or the ISO-8859-X family) or unaffected multibyte (like\n UTF-8) encodings.\n\n\npsycopg and python-pgsql use the old encoding for binary data and\n may have to be updated.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is affected by these problems but\nwe're unable to correct the package.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.4.7-6sarge2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.4.13-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your postgresql packages.\n\n\n",
