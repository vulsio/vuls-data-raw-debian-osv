The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-1062](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1062)\nLurker's mechanism for specifying configuration files was\n vulnerable to being overridden. As lurker includes sections of\n unparsed config files in its output, an attacker could manipulate\n lurker into reading any file readable by the www-data user.\n* [CVE-2006-1063](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1063)\nIt is possible for a remote attacker to create or overwrite files\n in any writable directory that is named \"mbox\".\n* [CVE-2006-1064](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1064)\nMissing input sanitising allows an attacker to inject arbitrary\n web script or HTML.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain lurker packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2-5sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lurker package.\n\n\n",
