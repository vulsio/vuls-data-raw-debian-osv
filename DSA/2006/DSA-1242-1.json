This update disables the vulnerable code.\n* [CVE-2006-5790](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5790)\nUlf HĂ¤rnhammar of the Debian Security Audit Project discovered several\n format string vulnerabilities in elog, which may lead to execution of\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-5791](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5791)\nUlf HĂ¤rnhammar of the Debian Security Audit Project discovered \n cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the creation of new logbook\n entries.\n* [CVE-2006-6318](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6318)\nJayesh KS and Arun Kethipelly of OS2A discovered that elog performs\n insufficient error handling in config file parsing, which may lead to\n denial of service through a NULL pointer dereference.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.5.7+r1558-4+sarge3.\n\n\nThe upcoming stable distribution (etch) will no longer include elog.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6.2+r1754-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your elog package.\n\n\n",
