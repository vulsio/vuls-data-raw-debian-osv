	"details": "\nLoading malformed XML documents can cause buffer overflows in\nOpenOffice.org, a free office suite, and cause a denial of service or\nexecute arbitrary code. Â It turned out that the correction in DSA\n1104-1 was not sufficient, hence, another update. For completeness\nplease find the original advisory text below:\n\n\n\n> \n> Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenOffice.org, a free\n> office suite. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project\n> identifies the following problems:\n> \n> \n> * [CVE-2006-2198](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2198)\n> It turned out to be possible to embed arbitrary BASIC macros in\n>  documents in a way that OpenOffice.org does not see them but\n>  executes them anyway without any user interaction.\n> * [CVE-2006-2199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2199)\n> It is possible to evade the Java sandbox with specially crafted\n>  Java applets.\n> * [CVE-2006-3117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3117)\n> Loading malformed XML documents can cause buffer overflows and\n>  cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n> \n> \n> This update has the Mozilla component disabled, so that the\n> Mozilla/LDAP addressbook feature won't work anymore. It didn't work on\n> anything else than i386 on sarge either.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain OpenOffice.org\npackages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.3-9sarge3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.0.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your OpenOffice.org packages.\n\n\n",
