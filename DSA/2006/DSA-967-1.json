The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2005-4439](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4439)\n\"GroundZero Security\" discovered that elog insufficiently checks the\n size of a buffer used for processing URL parameters, which might lead\n to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-0347](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0347)\nIt was discovered that elog contains a directory traversal vulnerability\n in the processing of \"../\" sequences in URLs, which might lead to\n information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2006-0348](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0348)\nThe code to write the log file contained a format string vulnerability,\n which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-0597](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0597)\nOverly long revision attributes might trigger a crash due to a buffer\n overflow.\n* [CVE-2006-0598](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0598)\nThe code to write the log file does not enforce bounds checks properly,\n which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-0599](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0599)\nelog emitted different errors messages for invalid passwords and invalid\n users, which allows an attacker to probe for valid user names.\n* [CVE-2006-0600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0600)\nAn attacker could be driven into infinite redirection with a crafted\n \"fail\" request, which has denial of service potential.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain elog packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.5.7+r1558-4+sarge2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6.1+r1642-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your elog package.\n\n\n",
