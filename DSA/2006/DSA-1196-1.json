	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ClamAV malware\nscan engine, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2006-4182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4182)\nDamian Put discovered a heap overflow error in the script to rebuild\n PE files, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-5295](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5295)\nDamian Put discovered that missing input sanitising in the CHM\n handling code might lead to denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.84-2.sarge.11. Due to technical problems with the build host\nthis update lacks a build for the Sparc architecture. It will be\nprovided soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.88.5-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.\n\n\n",
