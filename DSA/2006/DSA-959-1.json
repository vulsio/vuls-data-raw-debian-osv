This can lead to arbitrary code execution if\nan attacker provides a crafted ALZ archive.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain unalz.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.30.1\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unalz package.\n\n\n",
