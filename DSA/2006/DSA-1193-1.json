This release lacks builds for the\nMotorola 680x0 architecture, which failed due to diskspace constraints\non the build host. They will be released once this problem has been\nresolved.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed\nin version 1:1.2.2-1 of libxfont and version 1:1.0.2-9 of xorg-server.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your XFree86 packages.\n\n\n",
