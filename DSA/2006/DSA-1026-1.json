This flaw can\ncause programs which use zlib to crash when opening an invalid file.\nA further error in the way zlib handles the inflation of certain\ncompressed files can cause a program which uses zlib to crash when opening\nan invalid file.\n\n\nsash, the stand-alone shell, links statically against zlib, and was\nthus affected by these problems.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) isn't affected by these problems.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.7-5sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.7-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sash package.\n\n\n",
