	"summary": "squirrelmail",
	"details": "\nMartijn Brinkers discovered cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in\nthe mailto parameter of webmail.php, the session and delete\\_draft\nparameters of compose.php and through a shortcoming in the magicHTML\nfilter. An attacker could abuse these to execute malicious JavaScript in\nthe user's webmail session. \n\n\nAlso, a workaround was made for Internet Explorer <= 5: IE will attempt\nto guess the MIME type of attachments based on content, not the MIME \nheader sent. Attachments could fake to be a 'harmless' JPEG, while they\nwere in fact HTML that Internet Explorer would render.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2:1.4.4-10.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed\nin version 2:1.4.9a-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2:1.4.9a-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.\n\n\n",
