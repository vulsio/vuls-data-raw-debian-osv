This update also adds return value checks to setuid() calls, which\nmay fail in some PAM configurations.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.17-20sarge2.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem has been\nfixed in version 0.17-22.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.17-22.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ftpd package.\n\n\n",
