	"details": "\nUlf HĂ¤rnhammar and an anonymous researcher from Germany discovered a\nvulnerability in the protocol code of freshclam, a command line\nutility responsible for downloading and installing virus signature\nupdates for ClamAV, the antivirus scanner for Unix. This could lead\nto a denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain clamav packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.84-2.sarge.9.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.88.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.\n\n\n",
