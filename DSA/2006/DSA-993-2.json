	"summary": "gnupg - remote",
	"details": "\nTavis Ormandy noticed that gnupg, the GNU privacy guard - a free PGP\nreplacement, can be tricked to emit a \"good signature\" status message\nwhen a valid signature is included which does not belong to the data\npacket. This update basically adds fixed packages for woody whose\nversion turned out to be vulnerable as well.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.6-4woody5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.1-1.sarge3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.2.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnupg package.\n\n\n",
