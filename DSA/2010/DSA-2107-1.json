	"details": "\nDan Rosenberg discovered that in couchdb, a distributed,\nfault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database, an insecure\nlibrary search path is used. A local attacker could execute arbitrary\ncode by first dumping a maliciously crafted shared library in some\ndirectory, and then having an administrator run couchdb from this same\ndirectory.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.0-2+lenny1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your couchdb package.\n\n\n",
