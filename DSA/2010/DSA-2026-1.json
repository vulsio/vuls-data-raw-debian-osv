	"details": "\nMarc Schoenefeld discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the XPM reader\nimplementation in netpbm-free, a suite of image manipulation utilities.\nAn attacker could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code via an XPM image file that contains a crafted header\nfield associated with a large color index value.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:10.0-12+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:10.0-12.1+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nDue to a problem with the archive system it is not possible to release\nall architectures. The missing architectures will be installed into the\narchive once they become available.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your netpbm-free package.\n\n\n",
