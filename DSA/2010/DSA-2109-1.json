	"details": "\nA vulnerability has been discovered in samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print,\nand login server for Unix.\n\n\nThe sid\\_parse() function does not correctly check its input lengths\nwhen reading a binary representation of a Windows SID (Security ID).\nThis allows a malicious client to send a sid that can overflow the\nstack variable that is being used to store the SID in the Samba smbd\nserver. ([CVE-2010-3069](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3069))\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.2.5-4lenny13.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),\nthis problem will be fixed in version 3.5.5~dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your samba packages. The packages for the\nmips architecture are not included in this upgrade. They will be released\nas soon as they become available.\n\n\n",
