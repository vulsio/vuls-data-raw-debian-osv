	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in dokuwiki, a standards compliant\nsimple to use wiki.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-0287](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0287)\nIt was discovered that an internal variable is not properly sanitized before\nbeing used to list directories. This can be exploited to list contents of\narbitrary directories.\n* [CVE-2010-0288](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0288)\nIt was discovered that the ACL Manager plugin doesn't properly check the\nadministrator permissions. This allow an attacker to introduce arbitrary ACL\nrules and thus gaining access to a closed Wiki.\n* [CVE-2010-0289](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0289)\nIt was discovered that the ACL Manager plugin doesn't have protections against\ncross-site request forgeries (CSRF). This can be exploited to change the\naccess control rules by tricking a logged in administrator into visiting\na malicious web site.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.0.20080505-4+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.0.20090214b-3.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dokuwiki package.\n\n\n",
