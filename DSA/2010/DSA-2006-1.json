	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in sudo, a program\ndesigned to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges to users.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-0426](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0426)\nIt was discovered that sudo when a pseudo-command is enabled, permits a\nmatch between the name of the pseudo-command and the name of an\nexecutable file in an arbitrary directory, which allows local users to\ngain privileges via a crafted executable file.\n* [CVE-2010-0427](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0427)\nIt was discovered that sudo when the runas\\_default option is used, does\nnot properly set group memberships, which allows local users to gain privileges\nvia a sudo command.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.9p17-2+lenny1\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.7.2p1-1.2, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)\nshortly.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo package.\n\n\n",
