	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL\ndatabase server.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-4019](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4019)\nDomas Mituzas discovered that mysqld does not properly handle errors during\nexecution of certain SELECT statements with subqueries, and does not preserve\ncertain null\\_value flags during execution of statements that use the\nGeomFromWKB function, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a\ndenial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted statement.\n* [CVE-2009-4030](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4030)\nSergei Golubchik discovered that MySQL allows local users to bypass certain\nprivilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified\nDATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are originally associated\nwith pathnames without symlinks, and that can point to tables created at\na future time at which a pathname is modified to contain a symlink to a\nsubdirectory of the MySQL data home directory.\n* [CVE-2009-4484](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4484)\nMultiple stack-based buffer overflows in the CertDecoder::GetName function\nin src/asn.cpp in TaoCrypt in yaSSL before 1.9.9, as used in mysqld, allow\nremote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service\n(memory corruption and daemon crash) by establishing an SSL connection and\nsending an X.509 client certificate with a crafted name field.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.0.32-7etch12\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.0.51a-24+lenny3\n\n\nThe testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain\nmysql-dfsg-5 anymore.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.\n\n\n",
