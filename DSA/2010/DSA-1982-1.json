	"details": "\nJulien Cristau discovered that hybserv, a daemon running IRC services\nfor IRCD-Hybrid, is prone to a denial of service attack via the commands\noption.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.9.2-4+lenny2.\n\n\nDue to a bug in the archive system, it is not possible to release the\nfix for the oldstable distribution (etch) simultaneously. Therefore,\netch will be fixed in version 1.9.2-4+etch1 as soon as it becomes\navailable.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.9.2-4.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your hybserv packages.\n\n\n",
