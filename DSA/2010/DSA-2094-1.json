	"summary": "linux-2.6 - several issues",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-4895](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4895)\nKyle Bader reported an issue in the tty subsystem that allows local\n users to create a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference).\n* [CVE-2010-2226](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2226)\nDan Rosenberg reported an issue in the xfs filesystem that allows local\n users to copy and read a file owned by another user, for which they\n only have write permissions, due to a lack of permission checking in the\n XFS\\_SWAPEXT ioctl.\n* [CVE-2010-2240](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2240)\nRafal Wojtczuk reported an issue that allows users to obtain escalated\n privileges. Users must already have sufficient privileges to execute or\n connect clients to an Xorg server.\n* [CVE-2010-2248](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2248)\nSuresh Jayaraman discovered an issue in the CIFS filesystem. A malicious\n file server can set an incorrect \"CountHigh\" value, resulting in a\n denial of service (BUG\\_ON() assertion).\n* [CVE-2010-2521](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2521)\nNeil Brown reported an issue in the NFSv4 server code. A malicious client\n could trigger a denial of service (Oops) on a server due to a bug in\n the read\\_buf() routine.\n* [CVE-2010-2798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2798)\nBob Peterson reported an issue in the GFS2 file system. A file system\n user could cause a denial of service (Oops) via certain rename\n operations.\n* [CVE-2010-2803](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2803)\nKees Cook reported an issue in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager)\n subsystem. Local users with sufficient privileges (local X users\n or members of the 'video' group on a default Debian install) could\n acquire access to sensitive kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2010-2959](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2959)\nBen Hawkes discovered an issue in the AF\\_CAN socket family. An integer\n overflow condition may allow local users to obtain elevated privileges.\n* [CVE-2010-3015](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3015)\nToshiyuki Okajima reported an issue in the ext4 filesystem. Local users\n could trigger a denial of service (BUG assertion) by generating a specific\n set of filesystem operations.\n\n\nThis update also includes fixes a regression introduced by a previous\nupdate. See the referenced Debian bug page for details.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.26-24lenny1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux\npackages.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional source packages that were\nrebuilt for compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 5.0 (lenny) |\n| --- | --- |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.26-1um-2+24lenny1 |\n\n\nUpdates for arm and mips will be released as they become\navailable.\n\n\n",
