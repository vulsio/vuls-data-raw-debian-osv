	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in gzip, the GNU compression\nutilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-2624](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2624)\nThiemo Nagel discovered a missing input sanitation flaw in the way gzip\nused to decompress data blocks for dynamic Huffman codes, which could\nlead to the execution of arbitrary code when trying to decompress a\ncrafted archive. This issue is a reappearance of [CVE-2006-4334](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4334) and only\naffects the lenny version.\n* [CVE-2010-0001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0001)\nAki Helin discovered an integer underflow when decompressing files that\nare compressed using the LZW algorithm. This could lead to the execution\nof arbitrary code when trying to decompress a crafted LZW compressed\ngzip archive.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.12-6+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.5-15+etch1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gzip packages.\n\n\n",
