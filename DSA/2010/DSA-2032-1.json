	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in libpng, a library for\nreading and writing PNG files. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-2042](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2042)\nlibpng does not properly parse 1-bit interlaced images with width values\nthat are not divisible by 8, which causes libpng to include\nuninitialized bits in certain rows of a PNG file and might allow remote\nattackers to read portions of sensitive memory via \"out-of-bounds\npixels\" in the file.\n* [CVE-2010-0205](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0205)\nlibpng does not properly handle compressed ancillary-chunk data that has\na disproportionately large uncompressed representation, which allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU\nconsumption, and application hang) via a crafted PNG file\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.27-2+lenny3.\n\n\nFor the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, these\nproblems have been fixed in version 1.2.43-1\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpng package.\n\n\n",
