	"details": "\nJamie Strandboge discovered that moin, a python clone of WikiWiki, does\nnot sufficiently sanitize the page name in \"Despam\" action, allowing remote\nattackers to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n\nIn addition, this update fixes a minor issue in the \"textcha\" protection, it\ncould be trivially bypassed by blanking the \"textcha-question\" and \"textcha-answer\"\nform fields.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.7.1-3+lenny4.\n\n\nFor the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, these problems\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your moin package.\n\n\n",
