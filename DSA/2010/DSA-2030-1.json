	"details": "\nIt was discovered that mahara, an electronic portfolio, weblog, and resume\nbuilder is not properly escaping input when generating a unique username\nbased on a remote user name from a single sign-on application. An attacker\ncan use this to compromise the mahara database via crafted user names.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.4-4+lenny5.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.\n\n\n",
