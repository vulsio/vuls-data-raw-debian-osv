	"details": "\nIt was discovered that sendmail, a Mail Transport Agent, does not properly handle\na '\\0' character in a Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate.\n\n\nThis allows an attacker to spoof arbitrary SSL-based SMTP servers via a crafted server\ncertificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, and to bypass intended\naccess restrictions via a crafted client certificate issued by a legitimate\nCertification Authority.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 8.13.8-3+etch1\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 8.14.3-5+lenny1\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 8.14.3-9.1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)\nshortly.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sendmail package.\n\n\n",
