	"details": "\ntixxDZ (DZCORE labs) discovered a vulnerability in vlc, the multimedia\nplayer and streamer. Missing data validation in vlc's real data transport\n(RDT) implementation enable an integer underflow and consequently an\nunbounded buffer operation. A maliciously crafted stream could thus enable\nan attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nNo Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifier is available for\nthis issue.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version\n0.8.6.h-4+lenny2.3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem was fixed in version\n1.0.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.\n\n\n",
