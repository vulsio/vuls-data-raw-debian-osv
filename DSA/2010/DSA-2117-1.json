	"summary": "apr-util - denial of service",
	"details": "\nAPR-util is part of the Apache Portable Runtime library which is used\nby projects such as Apache httpd and Subversion.\n\n\nJeff Trawick discovered a flaw in the apr\\_brigade\\_split\\_line() function\nin apr-util. A remote attacker could send crafted http requests to\ncause a greatly increased memory consumption in Apache httpd, resulting\nin a denial of service.\n\n\nThis upgrade fixes this issue. After the upgrade, any running apache2\nserver processes need to be restarted.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.12+dfsg-8+lenny5.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.9+dfsg-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apr-util packages.\n\n\n",
