	"summary": "squidguard - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that in squidguard, a URL redirector/filter/ACL plugin\nfor squid, several problems in src/sgLog.c and src/sgDiv.c allow remote\nusers to either:\n\n\n* cause a denial of service, by requesting long URLs containing many\n slashes; this forces the daemon into emergency mode, where it does not\n process requests anymore.\n* bypass rules by requesting URLs whose length is close to predefined\n buffer limits, in this case 2048 for squidguard and 4096 or 8192 for squid\n (depending on its version).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.0-8.4+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.0-9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squidguard package.\n\n\n",
