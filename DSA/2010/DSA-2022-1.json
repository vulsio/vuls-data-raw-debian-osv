	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in mediawiki, a web-based wiki\nengine. The following issues have been identified:\n\n\n* Insufficient input sanitization in the CSS validation code allows editors\nto display external images in wiki pages. This can be a privacy concern\non public wikis as it allows attackers to gather IP addresses and other\ninformation by linking these images to a web server under their control.\n* Insufficient permission checks have been found in thump.php which can lead\nto disclosure of image files that are restricted to certain users\n(e.g. with img\\_auth.php).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.12.0-2lenny4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:1.15.2-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:1.15.2-1.\n\n\n",
