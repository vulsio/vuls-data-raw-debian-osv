	"summary": "cups - arbitrary code execution",
	"details": "\nRonald Volgers discovered that the lppasswd component of the cups suite,\nthe Common UNIX Printing System, is vulnerable to format string attacks\ndue to insecure use of the LOCALEDIR environment variable. An attacker\ncan abuse this behaviour to execute arbitrary code via crafted localization\nfiles and triggering calls to \\_cupsLangprintf(). This works as the lppasswd\nbinary happens to be installed with setuid 0 permissions.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.8-1+lenny8.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.2-9.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.\n\n\n",
