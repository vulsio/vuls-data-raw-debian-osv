	"summary": "linux-2.6 - several issues",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leak.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-2492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2492)\nAndre Osterhues reported an issue in the eCryptfs subsystem. A buffer\n overflow condition may allow local users to cause a denial of service\n or gain elevated privileges.\n* [CVE-2010-2954](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2954)\nTavis Ormandy reported an issue in the irda subsystem which may allow\n local users to cause a denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference.\n* [CVE-2010-3078](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3078)\nDan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the XFS file system that allows\n local users to read potentially sensitive kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2010-3080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3080)\nTavis Ormandy reported an issue in the ALSA sequencer OSS emulation\n layer. Local users with sufficient privileges to open /dev/sequencer\n (by default on Debian, this is members of the 'audio' group) can\n cause a denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference.\n* [CVE-2010-3081](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3081)\nBen Hawkes discovered an issue in the 32-bit compatibility code\n for 64-bit systems. Local users can gain elevated privileges due\n to insufficient checks in compat\\_alloc\\_user\\_space allocations.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.26-25lenny1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux\npackages.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional source packages that were\nrebuilt for compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 5.0 (lenny) |\n| --- | --- |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.26-1um-2+25lenny1 |\n\n\n",
