The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-4329](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4329)\nCross site scripting was possible in search, that allowed\n a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2010-4480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4480)\nCross site scripting was possible in errors, that allowed\n a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2010-4481](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4481)\nDisplay of PHP's phpinfo() function was available to world, but only\n if this functionality had been enabled (defaults to off). This may\n leak some information about the host system.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.11.8.1-5+lenny7.\n\n\nFor the testing (squeeze) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems\nhave been fixed in version 3.3.7-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: [https://www.debian.org/security/]($(HOME)/security/)\n\n\n",
