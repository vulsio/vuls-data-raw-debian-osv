The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-3714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3714)\nMultiple remote file disclosure vulnerabilities in the jumpUrl\n mechanism and the Extension Manager allowed attackers to read\n files with the privileges of the account under which the web\n server was running.\n* [CVE-2010-3715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3715)\nThe TYPO3 backend contained several cross-site scripting\n vulnerabilities, and the RemoveXSS function did not filter\n all Javascript code.\n* [CVE-2010-3716](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3716)\nMalicious editors with user creation permission could escalate\n their privileges by creating new users in arbitrary groups, due\n to lack of input validation in the taskcenter.\n* [CVE-2010-3717](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3717)\nTYPO3 exposed a crasher bug in the PHP filter\\_var function,\n enabling attackers to cause the web server process to crash\n and thus consume additional system resources.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.2.5-1+lenny6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable\ndistribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version\n4.3.7-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your TYPO3 packages.\n\n\n",
