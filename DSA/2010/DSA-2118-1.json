	"summary": "subversion - authentication bypass",
	"details": "\nKamesh Jayachandran and C. Michael Pilat discovered that the mod\\_dav\\_svn\nmodule of Subversion, a version control system, is not properly enforcing\naccess rules which are scope-limited to named repositories. If the\nSVNPathAuthz option is set to short\\_circuit set this may enable an\nunprivileged attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and disclose\nor modify repository content.\n\n\nAs a workaround it is also possible to set SVNPathAuthz to on but be\nadvised that this can result in a performance decrease for large\nrepositories.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.5.1dfsg1-5.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.12dfsg-2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.12dfsg-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.\n\n\n",
