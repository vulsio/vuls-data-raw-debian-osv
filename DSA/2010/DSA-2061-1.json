	"summary": "samba - arbitrary code execution",
	"details": "\nJun Mao discovered that Samba, an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol\nfor Unix systems, is not properly handling certain offset values when\nprocessing chained SMB1 packets. This enables an unauthenticated attacker\nto write to an arbitrary memory location resulting in the possibility to\nexecute arbitrary code with root privileges or to perform denial of service\nattacks by crashing the samba daemon.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.2.5-4lenny12.\n\n\nThis problem does not affect the versions in the testing (squeeze) and\nunstable (sid) distribution.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.\n\n\n",
