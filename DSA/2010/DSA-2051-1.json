The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-1169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1169)\nTim Bunce discovered that the implementation of the procedural\n language PL/Perl insufficiently restricts the subset of allowed\n code, which allows authenticated users the execution of arbitrary\n Perl code.\n* [CVE-2010-1170](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1170)\nTom Lane discovered that the implementation of the procedural\n language PL/Tcl insufficiently restricts the subset of allowed\n code, which allows authenticated users the execution of arbitrary\n Tcl code.\n* [CVE-2010-1975](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1975)\nIt was discovered that an unprivileged user could reset\n superuser-only parameter settings.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 8.3.11-0lenny1. This update also introduces a fix for \n[CVE-2010-0442](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0442), which was originally scheduled for the next Lenny point\nupdate.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 8.4.4-1 of postgresql-8.4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.3 packages.\n\n\n",
