	"summary": "wget - potential code execution",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that wget, a command line tool for downloading files\nfrom the WWW, uses server-provided file names when creating local\nfiles. This may lead to code execution in some scenarios.\n\n\nAfter this update, wget will ignore server-provided file names. You\ncan restore the old behavior in cases where it is not desirable by\ninvoking wget with the new --use-server-file-name option.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.11.4-2+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wget package.\n\n\n",
