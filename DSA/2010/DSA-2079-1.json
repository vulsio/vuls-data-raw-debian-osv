	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in mapserver, a CGI-based\nweb framework to publish spatial data and interactive mapping applications.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-2539](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2539)\nA stack-based buffer overflow in the msTmpFile function might lead to\n arbitrary code execution under some conditions.\n* [CVE-2010-2540](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2540)\nIt was discovered that the CGI debug command-line arguments which are\n enabled by default are insecure and may allow a remote attacker to\n execute arbitrary code. Therefore they have been disabled by default.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.0.3-3+lenny5.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.6.4-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.6.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mapserver packages.\n\n\n",
