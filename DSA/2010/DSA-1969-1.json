	"summary": "krb5 - denial of service",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that krb5, a system for authenticating users and services on a\nnetwork, is prone to integer underflow in the AES and RC4 decryption operations of\nthe crypto library. A remote attacker can cause crashes, heap corruption, or,\nunder extraordinarily unlikely conditions, arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.4-7etch8.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8+dfsg~alpha1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 package.\n\n\n",
