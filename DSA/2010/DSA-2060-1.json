	"summary": "cacti - SQL injection",
	"details": "\nStefan Esser discovered that cacti, a front-end to rrdtool for monitoring\nsystems and services, is not properly validating input passed to the rra\\_id\nparameter of the graph.php script. Due to checking the input of $\\_REQUEST\nbut using $\\_GET input in a query an unauthenticated attacker is able to\nperform SQL injections via a crafted rra\\_id $\\_GET value and an additional\nvalid rra\\_id $\\_POST or $\\_COOKIE value.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.7b-2.1+lenny3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.7e-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.\n\n\n",
