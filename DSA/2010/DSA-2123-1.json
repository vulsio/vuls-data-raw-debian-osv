	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla's Network\nSecurity Services (NSS) library. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-3170](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3170)\nNSS recognizes a wildcard IP address in the subject's Common\n Name field of an X.509 certificate, which might allow\n man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via\n a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification\n Authority.\n* [CVE-2010-3173](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3173)\nNSS does not properly set the minimum key length for\n Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) mode, which makes it easier for\n remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms\n via a brute-force attack.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.12.3.1-0lenny2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable\ndistribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version\n3.12.8-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your NSS packages.\n\n\n",
