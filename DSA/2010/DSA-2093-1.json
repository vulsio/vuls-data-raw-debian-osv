	"details": "\nTwo security issues have been discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL\nPostScript/PDF interpreter. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-4897](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4897)\nA buffer overflow was discovered that allows remote attackers to\n execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF\n document containing a long name.\n* [CVE-2010-1628](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1628)\nDan Rosenberg discovered that ghostscript incorrectly handled certain\n recursive Postscript files. An attacker could execute arbitrary code\n via a PostScript file containing unlimited recursive procedure\n invocations, which trigger memory corruption in the stack of the\n interpreter.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 8.62.dfsg.1-3.2lenny5\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),\nthese problems have been fixed in version 8.71~dfsg2-4\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript package.\n\n\n",
