The following Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project ids identify them:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-1667](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1667)\nMultiple pages performed insufficient input sanitising, making them\n vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.\n* [CVE-2010-1668](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1668)\nMultiple forms lacked protection against cross-site request forgery\n attacks, therefore making them vulnerable.\n* [CVE-2010-1670](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1670)\nGregor Anzelj discovered that it was possible to accidentally\n configure an installation of mahara that allows access to another\n user's account without a password.\n* [CVE-2010-2479](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2479)\nCertain Internet Explorer-specific cross-site scripting\n vulnerabilities were discovered in HTML Purifier, of which a copy\n is included in the mahara package.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), the problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.4-4+lenny6.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), the problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), the problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.\n\n\n",
