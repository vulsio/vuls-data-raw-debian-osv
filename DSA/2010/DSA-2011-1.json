	"details": "\nWilliam Grant discovered that the dpkg-source component of dpkg, the\nlow-level infrastructure for handling the installation and removal of\nDebian software packages, is vulnerable to path traversal attacks.\nA specially crafted Debian source package can lead to file modification\noutside of the destination directory when extracting the package content.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.14.29.\n\n\nFor the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution this problem\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.\n\n\n",
