	"summary": "ejabberd - denial of service",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that in ejabberd, a distributed XMPP/Jabber server\nwritten in Erlang, a problem in ejabberd\\_c2s.erl allows remote\nauthenticated users to cause a denial of service by sending a large\nnumber of c2s (client2server) messages; that triggers an overload of the\nqueue, which in turn causes a crash of the ejabberd daemon.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.0.1-6+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.2-2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.2-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ejabberd packages.\n\n\n",
