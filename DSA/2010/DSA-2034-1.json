The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-7251](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-7251)\nphpMyAdmin may create a temporary directory, if the configured directory\n does not exist yet, with insecure filesystem permissions.\n* [CVE-2008-7252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-7252)\nphpMyAdmin uses predictable filenames for temporary files, which may\n lead to a local denial of service attack or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2009-4605](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4605)\nThe setup.php script shipped with phpMyAdmin may unserialize untrusted\n data, allowing for cross site request forgery.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version\nphpmyadmin 2.11.8.1-5+lenny4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.2.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.\n\n\n",
