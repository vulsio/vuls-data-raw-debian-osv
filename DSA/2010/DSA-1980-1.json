	"details": "\nDavid Leadbeater discovered an integer underflow that could be triggered\nvia the LINKS command and can lead to a denial of service or the\nexecution of arbitrary code ([CVE-2009-4016](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4016)). This issue affects both,\nircd-hybrid and ircd-ratbox.\n\n\nIt was discovered that the ratbox IRC server is prone to a denial of\nservice attack via the HELP command. The ircd-hybrid package is not\nvulnerable to this issue ([CVE-2010-0300](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0300)).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:7.2.2.dfsg.2-4+lenny1 of the ircd-hybrid package and in\nversion 2.2.8.dfsg-2+lenny1 of ircd-ratbox.\n\n\nDue to a bug in the archive software it was not possible to release the\nfix for the oldstable distribution (etch) simultaneously. The packages\nwill be released as version 7.2.2.dfsg.2-3+etch1 once they become\navailable.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ircd-hybrid/ircd-ratbox packages.\n\n\n",
