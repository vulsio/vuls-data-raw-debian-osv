	"summary": "linux-2.6.24 - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nNOTE: This kernel update marks the final planned kernel security\nupdate for the 2.6.24 kernel in the Debian release 'etch'. Although\nsecurity support for 'etch' officially ended on Feburary 15th, 2010,\nthis update was already in preparation before that date.\n\n\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a denial of service, sensitive memory leak or privilege\nescalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-2691](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2691)\nSteve Beattie and Kees Cook reported an information leak in the\n maps and smaps files available under /proc. Local users may be\n able to read this data for setuid processes while the ELF binary\n is being loaded.\n* [CVE-2009-2695](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2695)\nEric Paris provided several fixes to increase the protection\n provided by the mmap\\_min\\_addr tunable against NULL pointer\n dereference vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2009-3080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3080)\nDave Jones reported an issue in the gdth SCSI driver. A missing\n check for negative offsets in an ioctl call could be exploited by\n local users to create a denial of service or potentially gain\n elevated privileges.\n* [CVE-2009-3726](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3726)\nTrond Myklebust reported an issue where a malicious NFS server\n could cause a denial of service condition on its clients by\n returning incorrect attributes during an open call.\n* [CVE-2009-3889](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3889)\nJoe Malicki discovered an issue in the megaraid\\_sas driver.\n Insufficient permissions on the sysfs dbg\\_lvl interface allow\n local users to modify the debug logging behavior.\n* [CVE-2009-4005](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4005)\nRoel Kluin discovered an issue in the hfc\\_usb driver, an ISDN\n driver for Colognechip HFC-S USB chip. A potential read overflow\n exists which may allow remote users to cause a denial of service\n condition (oops).\n* [CVE-2009-4020](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4020)\nAmerigo Wang discovered an issue in the HFS filesystem that would\n allow a denial of service by a local user who has sufficient\n privileges to mount a specially crafted filesystem.\n* [CVE-2009-4021](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4021)\nAnana V. Avati discovered an issue in the fuse subsystem. If the\n system is sufficiently low on memory, a local user can cause the\n kernel to dereference an invalid pointer resulting in a denial of\n service (oops) and potentially an escalation of privileges.\n* [CVE-2009-4138](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4138)\nJay Fenlason discovered an issue in the firewire stack that allows\n local users to cause a denial of service (oops or crash) by making\n a specially crafted ioctl call.\n* [CVE-2009-4308](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4308)\nTed Ts'o discovered an issue in the ext4 filesystem that allows\n local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer\n dereference). For this to be exploitable, the local user must\n have sufficient privileges to mount a filesystem.\n* [CVE-2009-4536](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4536)\n[CVE-2009-4538](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4538)\nFabian Yamaguchi reported issues in the e1000 and e1000e drivers\n for Intel gigabit network adapters which allow remote users to\n bypass packet filters using specially crafted Ethernet frames.\n* [CVE-2010-0003](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0003)\nAndi Kleen reported a defect which allows local users to gain read\n access to memory reachable by the kernel when the\n print-fatal-signals option is enabled. This option is disabled by\n default.\n* [CVE-2010-0007](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0007)\nFlorian Westphal reported a lack of capability checking in the\n ebtables netfilter subsystem. If the ebtables module is loaded,\n local users can add and modify ebtables rules.\n* [CVE-2010-0291](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0291)\nAl Viro reported several issues with the mmap/mremap system calls\n that allow local users to cause a denial of service (system panic)\n or obtain elevated privileges.\n* [CVE-2010-0410](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0410)\nSebastian Krahmer discovered an issue in the netlink connector\n subsystem that permits local users to allocate large amounts of\n system memory resulting in a denial of service (out of memory).\n* [CVE-2010-0415](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0415)\nRamon de Carvalho Valle discovered an issue in the sys\\_move\\_pages\n interface, limited to amd64, ia64 and powerpc64 flavors in Debian.\n Local users can exploit this issue to cause a denial of service\n (system crash) or gain access to sensitive kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2010-0622](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0622)\nJerome Marchand reported an issue in the futex subsystem that\n allows a local user to force an invalid futex state which results\n in a denial of service (oops).\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.9etch3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.\n\n\n",
