	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FreeType font \nlibrary. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-1797](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1797)\nMultiple stack-based buffer overflows in the \n cff\\_decoder\\_parse\\_charstrings function in the CFF Type2 CharStrings\n interpreter in cff/cffgload.c in FreeType allow remote attackers to\n execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory\n corruption) via crafted CFF opcodes in embedded fonts in a PDF\n document, as demonstrated by JailbreakMe.\n* [CVE-2010-2541](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2541)\nBuffer overflow in ftmulti.c in the ftmulti demo program in FreeType\n allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application\n crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted font file.\n* [CVE-2010-2805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2805)\nThe FT\\_Stream\\_EnterFrame function in base/ftstream.c in FreeType does\n not properly validate certain position values, which allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or\n possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted font file\n* [CVE-2010-2806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2806)\nArray index error in the t42\\_parse\\_sfnts function in\n type42/t42parse.c in FreeType allows remote attackers to cause a\n denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\n code via negative size values for certain strings in FontType42 font\n files, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\n* [CVE-2010-2807](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2807)\nFreeType uses incorrect integer data types during bounds checking,\n which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted\n font file.\n* [CVE-2010-2808](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2808)\nBuffer overflow in the Mac\\_Read\\_POST\\_Resource function in\n base/ftobjs.c in FreeType allows remote attackers to cause a denial\n of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly\n execute arbitrary code via a crafted Adobe Type 1 Mac Font File (aka\n LWFN) font.\n* [CVE-2010-3053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3053)\nbdf/bdflib.c in FreeType allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service (application crash) via a crafted BDF font file, related to\n an attempted modification of a value in a static string.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.3.7-2+lenny3\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution\n(squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version 2.4.2-1\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your freetype package.\n\n\n",
