	"summary": "openoffice.org - arbitrary code execution",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that OpenOffice.org, a full-featured office productivity\nsuite that provides a near drop-in replacement for MicrosoftÂ® Office, is\nnot properly handling python macros embedded in an office document. This\nallows an attacker to perform user-assisted execution of arbitrary code in\ncertain use cases of the python macro viewer component.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.4.1+dfsg-1+lenny7.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:3.2.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.\n\n\n",
