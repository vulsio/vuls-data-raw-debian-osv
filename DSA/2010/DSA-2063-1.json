	"details": "\nDan Rosenberg discovered that pmount, a wrapper around the standard mount\nprogram which permits normal users to mount removable devices without a\nmatching /etc/fstab entry, creates files in /var/lock insecurely.\nA local attacker could overwrite arbitrary files utilising a symlink attack.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.18-2+lenny1\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.23-1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)\nshortly.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pmount package.\n\n\n",
