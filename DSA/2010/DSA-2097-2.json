	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool\nto administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-3055](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3055)\nThe configuration setup script does not properly sanitise its output\n file, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via\n a crafted POST request. In Debian, the setup tool is protected through\n Apache HTTP basic authentication by default.\n* [CVE-2010-3056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3056)\nVarious cross site scripting issues have been discovered that allow\n a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.11.8.1-5+lenny5.\n\n\nFor the testing (squeeze) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems\nhave been fixed in version 3.3.5.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.\n\n\n",
