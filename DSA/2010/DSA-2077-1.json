The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-0211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0211)\nThe slap\\_modrdn2mods function in modrdn.c in OpenLDAP 2.4.22 does\n not check the return value of a call to the smr\\_normalize\n function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service (segmentation fault) and possibly execute arbitrary code\n via a modrdn call with an RDN string containing invalid UTF-8\n sequences.\n* [CVE-2010-0212](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0212)\nOpenLDAP 2.4.22 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service (crash) via a modrdn call with a zero-length RDN\n destination string.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.11-1+lenny2. (The missing update for the mips\narchitecture will be provided soon.)\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.23-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openldap packages.\n\n\n",
