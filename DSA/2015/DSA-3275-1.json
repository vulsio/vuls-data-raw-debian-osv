A remote attacker can use this flaw\nto execute arbitrary code as root via a specially crafted URL.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.3.2+20141104-3+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your fusionforge packages.\n\n\n",
