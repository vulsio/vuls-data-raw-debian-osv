	"details": "\nIt was discovered that the texttopdf utility, part of cups-filters, was\nsusceptible to multiple heap-based buffer overflows due to improper\nhandling of print jobs with a specially crafted line size. This could\nallow remote attackers to crash texttopdf or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.0.18-2.1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.61-5+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.71-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cups-filters packages.\n\n\n",
