	"details": "\nAndrey Labunets of Facebook discovered that cURL, an URL transfer\nlibrary, fails to properly handle URLs with embedded end-of-line\ncharacters. An attacker able to make an application using libcurl to\naccess a specially crafted URL via an HTTP proxy could use this flaw to\ndo additional requests in a way that was not intended, or insert\nadditional request headers into the request.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.26.0-1+wheezy12.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be\nfixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.38.0-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\n",
