	"details": "\nJakub Zalas discovered that Symfony, a framework to create websites and\nweb applications, was vulnerable to restriction bypass. It was\naffecting applications with ESI or SSI support enabled, that use the\nFragmentListener. A malicious user could call any controller via the\n/\\_fragment path by providing an invalid hash in the URL (or removing\nit), bypassing URL signing and security rules.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.21+dfsg-4+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed\nin version 2.7.0~beta2+dfsg-2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.7.0~beta2+dfsg-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your symfony packages.\n\n\n",
