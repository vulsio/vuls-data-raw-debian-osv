By carefully crafting a\ncorrupt ZIP archive an attacker can trigger a heap overflow, resulting\nin application crash or possibly having other unspecified impact.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.0-8+deb7u2. Additionally this update corrects a defective\npatch applied to address [CVE-2014-8139](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8139), which caused a regression with\nexecutable jar files.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.0-15. The defective patch applied to address [CVE-2014-8139](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8139) was\ncorrected in version 6.0-16.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.\n\n\n",
