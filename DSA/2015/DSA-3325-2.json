	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-3183](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3183)\nAn HTTP request smuggling attack was possible due to a bug in\n parsing of chunked requests. A malicious client could force the\n server to misinterpret the request length, allowing cache poisoning\n or credential hijacking if an intermediary proxy is in use.\n* [CVE-2015-3185](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3185)\nA design error in the ap\\_some\\_auth\\_required function renders the\n API unusuable in apache2 2.4.x. This could lead to modules using\n this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so.\n The fix backports the new ap\\_some\\_authn\\_required API from 2.4.16.\n This issue does not affect the oldstable distribution (wheezy).\n\n\nIn addition, the updated package for the oldstable distribution (wheezy)\nremoves a limitation of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters to 1024 bits.\nThis limitation may potentially allow an attacker with very large\ncomputing resources, like a nation-state, to break DH key exchange by\nprecomputation. The updated apache2 package also allows to configure\ncustom DH parameters. More information is contained in the\nchangelog.Debian.gz file.\nThese improvements were already present in the stable, testing, and\nunstable distributions.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2.2.22-13+deb7u5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.10-10+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed\nsoon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\n",
