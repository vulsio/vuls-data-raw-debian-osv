This could allow\n remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary\n code execution via crafted MP4 files.\n* [CVE-2014-9627](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9627)\nThe MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check\n that the conversion of the box length from 64bit integer to 32bit\n integer on 32bit platforms did not cause a truncation, leading to\n a possible buffer overflow. This could allow remote attackers to\n cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code execution via\n crafted MP4 files.\n* [CVE-2014-9628](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9628)\nThe MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check\n the length of the box, leading to a possible buffer overflow.

This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service (crash) or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.3-5+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been\nfixed in version 2.2.0~rc2-2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.0~rc2-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.\n\n\n",
