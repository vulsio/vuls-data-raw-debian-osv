	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a denial of service or information leaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-6885](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6885)\nIt was discovered that under specific circumstances, a combination\n of write operations to write-combined memory and locked CPU\n instructions may cause a core hang on AMD 16h 00h through 0Fh\n processors. A local user can use this flaw to mount a denial of\n service (system hang) via a crafted application.\n\n\nFor more information please refer to the AMD CPU erratum 793 in\n <http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/51810_16h_00h-0Fh_Rev_Guide.pdf>\n* [CVE-2014-8133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8133)\nIt was found that the espfix funcionality can be bypassed by\n installing a 16-bit RW data segment into GDT instead of LDT (which\n espfix checks for) and using it for stack. A local unprivileged user\n could potentially use this flaw to leak kernel stack addresses and\n thus allowing to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.\n* [CVE-2014-9419](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9419)\nIt was found that on Linux kernels compiled with the 32 bit\n interfaces (CONFIG\\_X86\\_32) a malicious user program can do a\n partial ASLR bypass through TLS base addresses leak when attacking\n other programs.\n* [CVE-2014-9529](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9529)\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel is affected by a race\n condition flaw when doing key garbage collection, allowing local\n users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic).\n* [CVE-2014-9584](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9584)\nIt was found that the Linux kernel does not validate a length value\n in the Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field, which allows\n local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a\n crafted iso9660 image.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.2.65-1+deb7u1. Additionally this update fixes a suspend/resume\nregression introduced with 3.2.65.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable\ndistribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\n",
