End users allowed to submit twig templates could\nuse specially crafted code to trigger remote code execution, even in\nsandboxed templates.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.16.2-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this\nproblem has been fixed in version 1.20.0-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your twig packages.\n\n\n",
