A privileged guest user could use this\n flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).\n* [CVE-2015-5279](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5279)\nQinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw\n in the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this\n flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or\n potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the\n privileges of the hosting QEMU process.\n* [CVE-2015-6815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6815)\nQinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in\n the e1000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this flaw\n to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).\n* [CVE-2015-6855](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6855)\nQinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a flaw in the IDE\n subsystem in QEMU occurring while executing IDE's\n WIN\\_READ\\_NATIVE\\_MAX command to determine the maximum size of a\n drive. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to mount a\n denial of service (QEMU process crash).\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.\n\n\n",
