	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in LXC, the Linux\nContainers userspace tools. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-1331](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1331)\nRoman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in LXC when\n creating lock files. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to\n create an arbitrary file as the root user.\n* [CVE-2015-1334](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1334)\nRoman Fiedler discovered that LXC incorrectly trusted the\n container's proc filesystem to set up AppArmor profile changes and\n SELinux domain transitions. A malicious container could create a\n fake proc filesystem and use this flaw to run programs inside the\n container that are not confined by AppArmor or SELinux.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:1.0.6-6+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1:1.0.7-4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:1.0.7-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lxc packages.\n\n\n",
