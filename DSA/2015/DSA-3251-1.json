	"summary": "dnsmasq - security update",
	"details": "\nNick Sampanis discovered that dnsmasq, a small caching DNS proxy and\nDHCP/TFTP server, did not properly check the return value of the\nsetup\\_reply() function called during a TCP connection, which is used\nthen as a size argument in a function which writes data on the client's\nconnection. A remote attacker could exploit this issue via a specially\ncrafted DNS request to cause dnsmasq to crash, or potentially to obtain\nsensitive information from process memory.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed\nin version 2.62-3+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.72-3+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq packages.\n\n\n",
