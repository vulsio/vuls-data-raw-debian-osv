	"details": "\nMiroslav Lichvar of Red Hat discovered multiple vulnerabilities in chrony,\nan alternative NTP client and server:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-1821](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1821)\nUsing particular address/subnet pairs when configuring access control\n would cause an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to\n cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2015-1822](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1822)\nWhen allocating memory to save unacknowledged replies to authenticated\n command requests, a pointer would be left uninitialized, which could\n trigger an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to cause a\n denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2015-1853](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1853)\nWhen peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric\n association, the internal state variables would be updated before the\n MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote\n attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization\n between NTP peers.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.24-3.1+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.30-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your chrony packages.\n\n\n",
