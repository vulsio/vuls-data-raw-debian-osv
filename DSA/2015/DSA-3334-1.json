	"details": "\nKurt Roeckx discovered that decoding a specific certificate with very\nlong DistinguishedName (DN) entries leads to double free. A remote\nattacker can take advantage of this flaw by creating a specially crafted\ncertificate that, when processed by an application compiled against\nGnuTLS, could cause the application to crash resulting in a denial of\nservice.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.3.8-6+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.3.17-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.\n\n\n",
