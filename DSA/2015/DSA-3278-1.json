	"details": "\nAn information disclosure flaw due to incorrect JkMount/JkUnmount\ndirectives processing was found in the Apache 2 module mod\\_jk to forward\nrequests from the Apache web server to Tomcat. A JkUnmount rule for a\nsubtree of a previous JkMount rule could be ignored. This could allow a\nremote attacker to potentially access a private artifact in a tree that\nwould otherwise not be accessible to them.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1:1.2.37-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:1.2.37-4+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1:1.2.40+svn150520-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:1.2.40+svn150520-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-jk packages.\n\n\n",
