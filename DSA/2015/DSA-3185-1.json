Ciphertext\n blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a\n quite noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.\n* [CVE-2015-0837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0837)\nThe modular exponentiation routine mpi\\_powm() was susceptible to a\n side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when\n accessing its internal pre-computed table.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.5.0-5+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libgcrypt11 packages.\n\n\n",
