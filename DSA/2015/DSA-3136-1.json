A remote attacker could exploit this flaw using\nspecially crafted certificates to mount a denial of service against an\napplication linked against the library (application crash), or\npotentially, to execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.9-1~deb7u5.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable\ndistribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.\n\n\n",
