	"details": "\nEmanuele Rocca discovered that ppp, a daemon implementing the\nPoint-to-Point Protocol, was subject to a buffer overflow when\ncommunicating with a RADIUS server. This would allow unauthenticated\nusers to cause a denial-of-service by crashing the daemon.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.5-5.1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable\ndistribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.4.6-3.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ppp packages.\n\n\n",
