	"details": "\nJann Horn discovered that the source package integrity verification in\ndpkg-source can be bypassed via a specially crafted Debian source\ncontrol file (.dsc). Note that this flaw only affects extraction of\nlocal Debian source packages via dpkg-source but not the installation of\npackages from the Debian archive.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.16.16. This update also includes non-security changes\npreviously scheduled for the next wheezy point release. See the Debian\nchangelog for details.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.17.25.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.\n\n\n",
