The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-0282](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0282)\nGnuTLS does not verify the RSA PKCS #1 signature algorithm to match\n the signature algorithm in the certificate, leading to a potential\n downgrade to a disallowed algorithm without detecting it.\n* [CVE-2015-0294](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0294)\nIt was reported that GnuTLS does not check whether the two signature\n algorithms match on certificate import.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.12.20-8+deb7u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.\n\n\n",
