	"details": "\nFernando MuĂąoz discovered that invalid HTML input passed to tidy, an\nHTML syntax checker and reformatter, could trigger a buffer overflow.\nThis could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)\nor potentially execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nGeoff McLane also discovered that a similar issue could trigger an\ninteger overflow, leading to a memory allocation of 4GB. This could\nallow remote attackers to cause a denial of service by saturating the\ntarget's memory.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 20091223cvs-1.2+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 20091223cvs-1.4+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tidy packages.\n\n\n",
