	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, information leaks\nor data corruption.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-1805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1805)\nRed Hat discovered that the pipe iovec read and write\n implementations may iterate over the iovec twice but will modify the\n iovec such that the second iteration accesses the wrong memory. A\n local user could use this flaw to crash the system or possibly for\n privilege escalation. This may also result in data corruption and\n information leaks in pipes between non-malicious processes.\n* [CVE-2015-3636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3636)\nWen Xu and wushi of KeenTeam discovered that users allowed to create\n ping sockets can use them to crash the system and, on 32-bit\n architectures, for privilege escalation. However, by default, no\n users on a Debian system have access to ping sockets.\n* [CVE-2015-4167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167)\nCarl Henrik Lunde discovered that the UDF implementation is missing\n a necessary length checks. A local user that can mount devices could\n use this flaw to crash the system.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.2.68-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems were fixed in\nversion 3.16.7-ckt11-1 or earlier, except for [CVE-2015-4167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167) which will\nbe fixed later.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\n",
