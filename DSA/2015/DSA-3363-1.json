The vulnerability\nallows man-in-the-middle attacks in situations where the server is using\nself-signed certificates and the connection is already established. If\nthe user in the client side manually distrusts the new certificate, the\nfile syncing will continue using the malicious server as valid.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.7.0~beta1+really1.6.4+dfsg-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1.8.4+dfsg-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8.4+dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your owncloud-client packages.\n\n\n",
