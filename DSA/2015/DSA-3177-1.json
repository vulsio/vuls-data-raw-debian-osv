	"details": "\nThomas Klute discovered that in mod-gnutls, an Apache module providing\nSSL and TLS encryption with GnuTLS, a bug caused the server's client\nverify mode not to be considered at all, in case the directory's\nconfiguration was unset. Clients with invalid certificates were then\nable to leverage this flaw in order to get access to that directory.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.5.10-1.1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.6-1.3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mod-gnutls packages.\n\n\n",
