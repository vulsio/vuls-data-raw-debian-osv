	"details": "\nSeveral denial-of-service issues have been discovered in Tor, a\nconnection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.\n\n\n* Jowr discovered that very high DNS query load on a relay could\n trigger an assertion error.\n* A relay could crash with an assertion error if a buffer of exactly\n the wrong layout was passed to buf\\_pullup() at exactly the wrong\n time.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.2.4.26-1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (jessie) and unstable distribution (sid),\nthese problems have been fixed in version 0.2.5.11-1.\n\n\nFurthermore, this update disables support for SSLv3 in Tor. All\nversions of OpenSSL in use with Tor today support TLS 1.0 or later.\n\n\nAdditionally, this release updates the geoIP database used by Tor as\nwell as the list of directory authority servers, which Tor clients use\nto bootstrap and who sign the Tor directory consensus document.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.\n\n\n",
