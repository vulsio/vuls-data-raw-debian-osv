	"details": "\nLoren Maggiore of Trail of Bits discovered that the 3GP parser of VLC, a\nmultimedia player and streamer, could dereference an arbitrary pointer\ndue to insufficient restrictions on a writable buffer. This could allow\nremote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted 3GP files.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.0~rc2-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed shortly.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.\n\n\n",
