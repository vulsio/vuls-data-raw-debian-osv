This could allow remote\nattackers to inject SQL queries after a database reconnection (e.g.\nwhen the backend PostgreSQL server is restarted).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:0.10.0-2.3+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:0.10.0-2.4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:0.10.0-2.4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your quassel packages.\n\n\n",
