An attacker with repository write access could\nthereby access any file on disk readable by the user the webserver\nruns as.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.3-1.1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.3-1.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your websvn packages.\n\n\n",
