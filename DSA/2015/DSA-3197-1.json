The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-0286](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0286)\nStephen Henson discovered that the ASN1\\_TYPE\\_cmp() function\n can be crashed, resulting in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2015-0287](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0287)\nEmilia Kaesper discovered a memory corruption in ASN.1 parsing.\n* [CVE-2015-0289](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0289)\nMichal Zalewski discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the\n PKCS#7 parsing code, resulting in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2015-0292](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0292)\nIt was discovered that missing input sanitising in base64 decoding\n might result in memory corruption.\n* [CVE-2015-0209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0209)\nIt was discovered that a malformed EC private key might result in\n memory corruption.\n* [CVE-2015-0288](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0288)\nIt was discovered that missing input sanitising in the\n X509\\_to\\_X509\\_REQ() function might result in denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.1e-2+deb7u15. In this update the export ciphers are removed\nfrom the default cipher list.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\n",
