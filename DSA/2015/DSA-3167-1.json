	"summary": "sudo - security update",
	"details": "\nJakub Wilk reported that sudo, a program designed to provide limited\nsuper user privileges to specific users, preserves the TZ variable from\na user's environment without any sanitization. A user with sudo access\nmay take advantage of this to exploit bugs in the C library functions\nwhich parse the TZ environment variable or to open files that the user\nwould not otherwise be able to open. The later could potentially cause\nchanges in system behavior when reading certain device special files or\ncause the program run via sudo to block.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8.5p2-1+nmu2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.\n\n\n",
