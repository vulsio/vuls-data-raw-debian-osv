This update is based on a new upstream version\nof unrtf including additional bug fixes, new features and incompatible\nchanges (especially PostScript support is dropped).\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable\ndistribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.21.5-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unrtf packages.\n\n\n",
