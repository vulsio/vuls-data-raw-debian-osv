This could allow remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code\n execution.\n* [CVE-2014-8080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8080), \n [CVE-2014-8090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8090)\nThe REXML parser could be coerced into allocating large string\n objects that could consume all available memory on the system. This\n could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.3.194-8.1+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been\nfixed in version 2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9.1 packages.\n\n\n",
