	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full\nvirtualization solution on x86 hardware.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-3209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3209)\nMatt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw\n in the way QEMU's AMD PCnet Ethernet emulation handles multi-TMD\n packets with a length above 4096 bytes. A privileged guest user in a\n guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card enabled can potentially use\n this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges\n of the hosting QEMU process.\n* [CVE-2015-4037](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4037)\nKurt Seifried of Red Hat Product Security discovered that QEMU's\n user mode networking stack uses predictable temporary file names\n when the -smb option is used. An unprivileged user can use this flaw\n to cause a denial of service.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.\n\n\n",
