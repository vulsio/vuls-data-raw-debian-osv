	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Dulwich, a Python\nimplementation of the file formats and protocols used by the Git version\ncontrol system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2014-9706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9706)\nIt was discovered that Dulwich allows writing to files under .git/\n when checking out working trees. This could lead to the execution of\n arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an\n application based on Dulwich.\n* [CVE-2015-0838](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0838)\nIvan Fratric of the Google Security Team has found a buffer\n overflow in the C implementation of the apply\\_delta() function,\n used when accessing Git objects in pack files. An attacker could\n take advantage of this flaw to cause the execution of arbitrary\n code with the privileges of the user running a Git server or client\n based on Dulwich.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.8.5-2+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been\nfixed in version 0.9.7-3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.10.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dulwich packages.\n\n\n",
