Installations which\nuse neither GnuPG nor S/MIME are unaffected by the second cross-site\nscripting vulnerability.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 4.0.7-5+deb7u4. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only\naffected by [CVE-2015-5475](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5475).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.2.8-3+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.2.11-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker4 packages.\n\n\n",
