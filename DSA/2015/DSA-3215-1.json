This\n could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via\n crafted XPM files.\n* [CVE-2014-9709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9709)\nImporting an invalid GIF file using the gdImageCreateFromGif() function\n would cause a read buffer overflow that could allow remote attackers to\n cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted GIF files.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-6.1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been\nfixed in version 2.1.0-5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.1.0-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.\n\n\n",
