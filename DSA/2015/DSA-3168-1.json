	"details": "\nKousuke Ebihara discovered that redcloth, a Ruby module used to\nconvert Textile markup to HTML, did not properly sanitize its\ninput. This allowed a remote attacker to perform a cross-site\nscripting attack by injecting arbitrary JavaScript code into the\ngenerated HTML.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.2.9-2+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.2.9-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby-redcloth packages.\n\n\n",
