	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor\nemulator.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-3214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3214)\nMatt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw\n in the QEMU i8254 PIT emulation. A privileged guest user in a guest\n with QEMU PIT emulation enabled could potentially use this flaw to\n execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the\n hosting QEMU process.\n* [CVE-2015-5154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5154)\nKevin Wolf of Red Hat discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw in the\n IDE subsystem in QEMU while processing certain ATAPI commands. A\n privileged guest user in a guest with the CDROM drive enabled could\n potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with\n the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.\n* [CVE-2015-5165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5165)\nDonghai Zhu discovered that the QEMU model of the RTL8139 network\n card did not sufficiently validate inputs in the C+ mode offload\n emulation, allowing a malicious guest to read uninitialized memory\n from the QEMU process's heap.\n* [CVE-2015-5225](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5225)\nMr Qinghao Tang from QIHU 360 Inc. and Mr Zuozhi from Alibaba Inc\n discovered a buffer overflow flaw in the VNC display driver leading\n to heap memory corruption. A privileged guest user could use this\n flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or\n potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the\n privileges of the hosting QEMU process.\n* [CVE-2015-5745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5745)\nA buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way QEMU\n handles the virtio-serial device. A malicious guest could use this\n flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u9. The oldstable distribution is only\naffected by [CVE-2015-5165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5165) and [CVE-2015-5745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5745).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:2.4+dfsg-1a.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.\n\n\n",
