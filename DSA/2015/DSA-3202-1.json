	"details": "\nResearchers at INRIA and Xamarin discovered several vulnerabilities in\nmono, a platform for running and developing applications based on the\nECMA/ISO Standards. Mono's TLS stack contained several problems that\nhampered its capabilities: those issues could lead to client\nimpersonation (via SKIP-TLS), SSLv2 fallback, and encryption weakening\n(via FREAK).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.10.8.1-8+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.2.8+dfsg-10.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mono packages.\n\n\n",
