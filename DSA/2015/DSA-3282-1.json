	"details": "\nAlexander E. Patrakov discovered an issue in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec\nsuite used to establish IPsec protected links.\n\n\nWhen an IKEv2 client authenticates the server with certificates and the\nclient authenticates itself to the server using pre-shared key or EAP,\nthe constraints on the server certificate are only enforced by the\nclient after all authentication steps are completed successfully. A\nrogue server which can authenticate using a valid certificate issued by\nany CA trusted by the client could trick the user into continuing the\nauthentication, revealing the username and password digest (for EAP) or\neven the cleartext password (if EAP-GTC is accepted).\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed\nin version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u7.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.2.1-6+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed\nin version 5.3.1-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.3.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\n",
