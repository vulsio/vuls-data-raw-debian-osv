	"details": "\nJohan Olofsson discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in\nStunnel, a program designed to work as an universal SSL tunnel for\nnetwork daemons. When Stunnel in server mode is used with the redirect\noption and certificate-based authentication is enabled with verify = 2\nor higher, then only the initial connection is redirected to the hosts\nspecified with redirect. This allows a remote attacker to bypass\nauthentication.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3:5.06-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed\nin version 3:5.18-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3:5.18-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your stunnel4 packages.\n\n\n",
