	"details": "\nA path traversal vulnerability was discovered in Mailman, the mailing\nlist manager. Installations using a transport script (such as\npostfix-to-mailman.py) to interface with their MTA instead of static\naliases were vulnerable to a path traversal attack. To successfully\nexploit this, an attacker needs write access on the local file system.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.1.15-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.1.18-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.\n\n\n",
