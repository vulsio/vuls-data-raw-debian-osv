	"details": "\nTibor Jager, JĂśrg Schwenk, and Juraj Somorovsky, from Horst GĂśrtz\nInstitute for IT Security, published a paper in ESORICS 2015 where they\ndescribe an invalid curve attack in Bouncy Castle Crypto, a Java library\nfor cryptography. An attacker is able to recover private Elliptic Curve\nkeys from different applications, for example, TLS servers.\n\n\nMore information:\n[\\\nhttp://web-in-security.blogspot.ca/2015/09/practical-invalid-curve-attacks.html](http://web-in-security.blogspot.ca/2015/09/practical-invalid-curve-attacks.html)\n  \n\nPractical Invalid Curve Attacks on TLS-ECDH:\n[\\\nhttp://euklid.org/pdf/ECC\\_Invalid\\_Curve.pdf](http://euklid.org/pdf/ECC_Invalid_Curve.pdf)\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1.44+dfsg-3.1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.49+dfsg-3+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.51-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bouncycastle packages.\n\n\n",
