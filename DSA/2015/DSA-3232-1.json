	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-3143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3143)\nNTLM-authenticated connections could be wrongly reused for requests\n without any credentials set, leading to HTTP requests being sent\n over the connection authenticated as a different user. This is\n similar to the issue fixed in DSA-2849-1.\n* [CVE-2015-3144](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3144)\nWhen parsing URLs with a zero-length hostname (such as \"http://:80\"),\n libcurl would try to read from an invalid memory address. This could\n allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash). This\n issue only affects the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid)\n distributions.\n* [CVE-2015-3145](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3145)\nWhen parsing HTTP cookies, if the parsed cookie's path element\n consists of a single double-quote, libcurl would try to write to an\n invalid heap memory address. This could allow remote attackers to\n cause a denial of service (crash). This issue only affects the\n upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions.\n* [CVE-2015-3148](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3148)\nWhen doing HTTP requests using the Negotiate authentication method\n along with NTLM, the connection used would not be marked as\n authenticated, making it possible to reuse it and send requests for\n one user over the connection authenticated as a different user.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.26.0-1+wheezy13.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been\nfixed in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.42.0-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\n",
