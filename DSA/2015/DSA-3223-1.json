	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ntp, an implementation of the\nNetwork Time Protocol:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-1798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1798)\nWhen configured to use a symmetric key with an NTP peer, ntpd would\n accept packets without MAC as if they had a valid MAC. This could\n allow a remote attacker to bypass the packet authentication and send\n malicious packets without having to know the symmetric key.\n* [CVE-2015-1799](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1799)\nWhen peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric\n association, ntpd would update its internal state variables before\n the MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote\n attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization\n between NTP peers.\n\n\nAdditionally, it was discovered that generating MD5 keys using ntp-keygen\non big endian machines would either trigger an endless loop, or generate\nnon-random keys.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.\n\n\n",
