If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a\nspecially crafted ace archive, an attacker could cause a denial of\nservice (application crash) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2b-10+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.2b-12.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2b-12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unace packages.\n\n\n",
