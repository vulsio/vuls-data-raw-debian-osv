This could allow remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service (crash).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in version\n1.8.7.358-7.1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version\n2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.8 packages.\n\n\n",
