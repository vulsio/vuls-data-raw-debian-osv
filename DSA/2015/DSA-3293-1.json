	"details": "\nTim McLean discovered that pyjwt, a Python implementation of JSON Web\nToken, would try to verify an HMAC signature using an RSA or ECDSA public\nkey as secret. This could allow remote attackers to trick applications\nexpecting tokens signed with asymmetric keys, into accepting arbitrary\ntokens. For more information see: [\\\nhttps://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.2.1-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pyjwt packages.\n\n\n",
