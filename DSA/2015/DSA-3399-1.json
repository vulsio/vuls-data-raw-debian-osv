A remote attacker can potentially\n take advantage of this flaw to cause disclosure of information from\n process memory.\n* [CVE-2015-8126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8126)\nMultiple buffer overflows were discovered in the png\\_set\\_PLTE and\n png\\_get\\_PLTE functions. A remote attacker can take advantage of this\n flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a small\n bit-depth value in an IHDR (image header) chunk in a PNG image.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.2.49-1+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.50-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.54-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.\n\n\n",
