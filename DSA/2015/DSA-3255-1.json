	"details": "\nIt was discovered that libzmq, a lightweight messaging kernel, is\nsusceptible to a protocol downgrade attack on sockets using the ZMTP v3\nprotocol. This could allow remote attackers to bypass ZMTP v3 security\nmechanisms by sending ZMTP v2 or earlier headers.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.5+dfsg-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.5+dfsg-3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.5+dfsg-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zeromq3 packages.\n\n\n",
