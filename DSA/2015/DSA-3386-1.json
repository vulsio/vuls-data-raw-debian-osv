The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-7696](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7696)\nGustavo Grieco discovered that unzip incorrectly handled certain\n password protected archives. If a user or automated system were\n tricked into processing a specially crafted zip archive, an attacker\n could possibly execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2015-7697](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7697)\nGustavo Grieco discovered that unzip incorrectly handled certain\n malformed archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into\n processing a specially crafted zip archive, an attacker could\n possibly cause unzip to hang, resulting in a denial of service.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 6.0-8+deb7u4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 6.0-16+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 6.0-19.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 6.0-19.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.\n\n\n",
