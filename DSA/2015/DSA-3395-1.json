The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-2695](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2695)\nIt was discovered that applications which call gss\\_inquire\\_context()\n on a partially-established SPNEGO context can cause the GSS-API\n library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a\n process crash.\n* [CVE-2015-2696](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2696)\nIt was discovered that applications which call gss\\_inquire\\_context()\n on a partially-established IAKERB context can cause the GSS-API\n library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a\n process crash.\n* [CVE-2015-2697](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2697)\nIt was discovered that the build\\_principal\\_va() function incorrectly\n handles input strings. An authenticated attacker can take advantage\n of this flaw to cause a KDC to crash using a TGS request with a\n large realm field beginning with a null byte.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.12.1+dfsg-19+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.13.2+dfsg-3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.13.2+dfsg-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.\n\n\n",
