	"details": "\nPound, a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer, had several issues\nrelated to vulnerabilities in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.\n\n\nFor Debian 7 (wheezy) this update adds a missing part to make it actually\npossible to disable client-initiated renegotiation and disables it by default\n([CVE-2009-3555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555)).\nTLS compression is disabled ([CVE-2012-4929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929)),\nalthough this is normally already disabled by the OpenSSL system library.\nFinally it adds the ability to disable the SSLv3 protocol ([CVE-2014-3566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566))\nentirely via the new DisableSSLv3 configuration directive, although it\nwill not disabled by default in this update. Additionally a non-security\nsensitive issue in redirect encoding is\naddressed.\n\n\nFor Debian 8 (jessie) these issues have been fixed prior to the release,\nwith the exception of client-initiated renegotiation ([CVE-2009-3555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555)).\nThis update addresses that issue for jessie.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2.6-2+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6-6+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6-6.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pound packages.\n\n\n",
