This flaw may lead to logic errors,\n including memory errors like double free flaws.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.9.10+dfsg-6.7+deb11u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libxml2 please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxml2>\n\n\n",
