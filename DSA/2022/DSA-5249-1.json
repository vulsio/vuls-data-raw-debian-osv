	"summary": "strongswan - security update",
	"details": "\nLahav Schlesinger discovered a vulnerability in the revocation plugin of\nstrongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite.\n\n\nThe revocation plugin uses OCSP URIs and CRL distribution points (CDP) which\ncome from certificates provided by the remote endpoint. The plugin didn't check\nfor the certificate chain of trust before using those URIs, so an attacker\ncould provided a crafted certificate containing URIs pointing to servers under\ntheir control, potentially leading to denial-of-service attacks.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.9.1-1+deb11u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of strongswan please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan)\n\n\n",
