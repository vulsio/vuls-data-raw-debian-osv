	"details": "\nDemi Marie Obenour discovered a flaw in GnuPG, allowing for signature\nspoofing via arbitrary injection into the status line. An attacker who\ncontrols the secret part of any signing-capable key or subkey in the\nvictim's keyring, can take advantage of this flaw to provide a\ncorrectly-formed signature that some software, including gpgme, will\naccept to have validity and signer fingerprint chosen from the attacker.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed\nin version 2.2.12-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.27-2+deb11u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnupg2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of gnupg2 please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/gnupg2](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/gnupg2)\n\n\n",
