	"details": "\nGreg Hudson discovered integer overflow flaws in the PAC parsing in\nkrb5, the MIT implementation of Kerberos, which may result in remote\ncode execution (in a KDC, kadmin, or GSS or Kerberos application server\nprocess), information exposure (to a cross-realm KDC acting\nmaliciously), or denial of service (KDC or kadmind process crash).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.18.3-6+deb11u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of krb5 please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/krb5>\n\n\n",
