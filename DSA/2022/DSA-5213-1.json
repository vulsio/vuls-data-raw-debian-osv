	"summary": "schroot - security update",
	"details": "\nJulian Gilbey discovered that schroot, a tool allowing users to execute\ncommands in a chroot environment, had too permissive rules on chroot or\nsession names, allowing a denial of service on the schroot service for\nall users that may start a schroot session.\n\n\nNote that existing chroots and sessions are checked during upgrade, and\nan upgrade is aborted if any future invalid name is detected.\n\n\nProblematic session and chroots can be checked before upgrading with the\nfollowing command:\n\n\n`schroot --list --all | LC_ALL=C grep -vE '^[a-z]+:[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*$'`\nSee \n\nfor instructions on how to resolve such a situation.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.10-12+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your schroot packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of schroot please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/schroot](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/schroot)\n\n\n",
