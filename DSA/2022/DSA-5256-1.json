In Debian the vulnerable code is in the bcel source package.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.5.0-1+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bcel packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of bcel please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bcel](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bcel)\n\n\n",
