	"summary": "strongswan - security update",
	"details": "\nZhuowei Zhang discovered a bug in the EAP authentication client code of\nstrongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite, that may allow to bypass the client and in some\nscenarios even the server authentication, or could lead to a denial-of-service\nattack.\n\n\nWhen using EAP authentication (RFC 3748), the successful completion of the\nauthentication is indicated by an EAP-Success message sent by the server to the\nclient. strongSwan's EAP client code handled early EAP-Success messages\nincorrectly, either crashing the IKE daemon or concluding the EAP method\nprematurely.\n\n\nEnd result depend on the used configuration, more details can be found in\nupstream advisory at\n[\\\nhttps://www.strongswan.org/blog/2022/01/24/strongswan-vulnerability-(cve-2021-45079).html](https://www.strongswan.org/blog/2022/01/24/strongswan-vulnerability-(cve-2021-45079).html)\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed\nin version 5.7.2-1+deb10u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.9.1-1+deb11u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of strongswan please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan)\n\n\n",
