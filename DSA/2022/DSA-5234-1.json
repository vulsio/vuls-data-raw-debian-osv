	"details": "\nAn arbitrary code execution vulnerability was disovered in fish, a\ncommand line shell. When using the default configuraton of fish,\nchanging to a directory automatically ran `git` commands in order to\ndisplay information about the current repository in the prompt. Such\nrepositories can contain per-repository configuration that change the\nbehavior of git, including running arbitrary commands.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.1.2-3+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your fish packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of fish please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/fish](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/fish)\n\n\n",
