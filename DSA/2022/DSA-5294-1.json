	"details": "\nJhead, a tool for manipulating EXIF data embedded in JPEG images, allowed\nattackers to execute arbitrary OS commands by placing them in a JPEG filename\nand then using the regeneration -rgt50, -autorot or -ce option. In addition a\nbuffer overflow error in exif.c has been addressed which could lead to a denial\nof service (application crash).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:3.04-6+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jhead packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of jhead please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jhead](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jhead)\n\n\n",
