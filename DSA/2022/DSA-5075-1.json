	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Minetest, a sandbox video game\nand game creation system. These issues may allow attackers to manipulate game\nmods and grant them an unfair advantage over other players. These flaws could\nalso be abused for a denial of service attack against a Minetest server or if\nuser input is passed directly to minetest.deserialize without serializing it\nfirst, then a malicious user could run Lua code in the server environment.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.4.17.1+repack-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.3.0+repack-2.1+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your minetest packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of minetest please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/minetest](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/minetest)\n\n\n",
