	"summary": "smarty3 - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in smarty3, the compiling\nPHP template engine. Template authors are able to run restricted static php\nmethods or even arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string or by\nchoosing an invalid {block} or {include} file name. If a math string was passed\nthrough as user provided data to the math function, remote users were able to\nrun arbitrary PHP code as well.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.1.33+20180830.1.3a78a21f+selfpack1-1+deb10u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.1.39-2+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your smarty3 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of smarty3 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/smarty3](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/smarty3)\n\n\n",
