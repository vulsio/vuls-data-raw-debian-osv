	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Gson, a Java library that can be used to convert Java\nObjects into their JSON representations and vice versa, was vulnerable to a deserialization flaw. An application would de-serialize untrusted data without\nsufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the\nattacker to control the state or the flow of the execution. This can lead to a\ndenial of service or even the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.8.6-1+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libgoogle-gson-java packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libgoogle-gson-java please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libgoogle-gson-java](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libgoogle-gson-java)\n\n\n",
