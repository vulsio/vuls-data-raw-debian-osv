	"details": "\nSecurity researchers of JFrog Security and Ismail Aydemir discovered two remote\ncode execution vulnerabilities in the H2 Java SQL database engine which can be\nexploited through various attack vectors, most notably through the H2 Console\nand by loading custom classes from remote servers through JNDI. The H2 console\nis a developer tool and not required by any reverse-dependency in Debian. It\nhas been disabled in (old)stable releases. Database developers are advised to\nuse at least version 2.1.210-1, currently available in Debian unstable.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.4.197-4+deb10u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.197-4+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your h2database packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of h2database please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/h2database](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/h2database)\n\n\n",
