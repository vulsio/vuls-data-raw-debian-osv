	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-4197](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4197)\nEric Biederman reported that incorrect permission checks in the\n cgroup process migration implementation can allow a local attacker\n to escalate privileges.\n* [CVE-2022-0168](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0168)\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the CIFS client\n implementation which can allow a local attacker with CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN\n privileges to crash the system. The security impact is negligible as\n CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN inherently gives the ability to deny service.\n* [CVE-2022-1016](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1016)\nDavid Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the\n nft\\_do\\_chain function did not initialize register data that\n nf\\_tables expressions can read from and write to. A local attacker\n can take advantage of this to read sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2022-1048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1048)\nHu Jiahui discovered a race condition in the sound subsystem that\n can result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a\n PCM sound device can take advantage of this flaw to crash the\n system or potentially for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-1158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1158)\nQiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan, and Yongkang Jia discovered a bug in the\n KVM implementation for x86 processors. A local user with access to\n /dev/kvm could cause the MMU emulator to update page table entry\n flags at the wrong address. They could exploit this to cause a\n denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-1195](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1195)\nLin Ma discovered race conditions in the 6pack and mkiss hamradio\n drivers, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could\n exploit these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or\n crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-1198](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1198)\nDuoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio\n driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could\n exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or\n crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-1199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1199),\n [CVE-2022-1204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1204),\n [CVE-2022-1205](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1205)\nDuoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 hamradio\n protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer\n dereference. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of\n service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-1353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1353)\nThe TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF\\_KEY\n subsystem. A local user can receive a netlink message when an\n IPsec daemon registers with the kernel, and this could include\n sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2022-1516](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1516)\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25\n set of standardized network protocols, which can result in denial\n of service.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2022-26490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26490)\nBuffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core driver can\n result in denial of service or privilege escalation.\n\n\nThis driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2022-27666](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-27666)\nvalis reported a possible buffer overflow in the IPsec ESP\n transformation code. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to\n cause a denial of service or for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-28356](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28356)\nBeraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did\n not properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A\n local attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial\n of service.\n* [CVE-2022-28388](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28388)\nA double free vulnerability was discovered in the 8 devices USB2CAN\n interface driver.\n* [CVE-2022-28389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28389)\nA double free vulnerability was discovered in the Microchip CAN BUS\n Analyzer interface driver.\n* [CVE-2022-28390](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28390)\nA double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-USB/ARM7\n CAN/USB interface driver.\n* [CVE-2022-29582](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-29582)\nJayden Rivers and David Bouman discovered a user-after-free\n vulnerability in the io\\_uring subystem due to a race condition in\n io\\_uring timeouts. A local unprivileged user can take advantage of\n this flaw for privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.10.113-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux)\n\n\n",
