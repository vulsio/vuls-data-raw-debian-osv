	"summary": "xfce4-settings - security update",
	"details": "\nRobin Peraglie and Johannes Moritz discovered an argument injection bug in the\nxfce4-mime-helper component of xfce4-settings, which can be exploited using the\nxdg-open common tool. Since xdg-open is used by multiple standard applications\nfor opening links, this bug could be exploited by an attacker to run arbitrary\ncode on an user machine by providing a malicious PDF file with specifically\ncrafted links.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.16.0-1+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xfce4-settings packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of xfce4-settings please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xfce4-settings](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xfce4-settings)\n\n\n",
