	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,\nprint, and login server for Unix.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-2031](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2031)\nLuke Howard reported that Samba AD users can bypass certain\n restrictions associated with changing passwords. A user who has been\n requested to change their password can exploit this to obtain and\n use tickets to other services.\n* [CVE-2022-32742](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32742)\nLuca Moro reported that a SMB1 client with write access to a share\n can cause server memory content to be leaked.\n* [CVE-2022-32744](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32744)\nJoseph Sutton reported that Samba AD users can forge password change\n requests for any user, resulting in privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2022-32745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32745)\nJoseph Sutton reported that Samba AD users can crash the server\n process with a specially crafted LDAP add or modify request.\n* [CVE-2022-32746](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32746)\nJoseph Sutton and Andrew Bartlett reported that Samba AD users can\n cause a use-after-free in the server process with a specially\n crafted LDAP add or modify request.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2:4.13.13+dfsg-1~deb11u5. The fix for\n[CVE-2022-32745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32745)\nrequired an update to ldb 2:2.2.3-2~deb11u2 to correct the defect.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of samba please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/samba](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/samba)\n\n\n",
