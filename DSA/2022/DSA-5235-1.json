	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server\nimplementation.\n\n\n* [CVE-2022-2795](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2795)\nYehuda Afek, Anat Bremler-Barr and Shani Stajnrod discovered that a\n flaw in the resolver code can cause named to spend excessive amounts\n of time on processing large delegations, significantly degrade\n resolver performance and result in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2022-3080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3080)\nMaksym Odinintsev discovered that the resolver can crash when stale\n cache and stale answers are enabled with a zero\n stale-answer-timeout. A remote attacker can take advantage of this\n flaw to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via specially\n crafted queries to the resolver.\n* [CVE-2022-38177](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-38177)\nIt was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA\n algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker\n can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,\n resulting in a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2022-38178](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-38178)\nIt was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA\n algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker\n can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,\n resulting in a denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:9.16.33-1~deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of bind9 please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bind9>\n\n\n",
