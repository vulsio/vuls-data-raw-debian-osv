	"details": "\nNick Wellnhofer discovered that the xsltApplyTemplates function in\nlibxslt, an XSLT processing runtime library, is prone to a\nuse-after-free flaw, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially\nthe execution of arbitrary code if a specially crafted file is\nprocessed.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.34-4+deb11u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of libxslt please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxslt](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxslt)\n\n\n",
