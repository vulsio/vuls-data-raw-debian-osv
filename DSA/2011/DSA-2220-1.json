(External custom fields are disabled by\n default.)\n* [CVE-2011-1686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1686)\nMultiple SQL injection attacks allow authenticated users to obtain\n data from the database in an unauthorized way.\n* [CVE-2011-1687](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1687)\nAn information leak allows an authenticated privileged user to\n obtain sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords, via the\n search interface.\n* [CVE-2011-1688](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1688)\nWhen running under certain web servers (such as Lighttpd), Request\n Tracker is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing\n attackers to read any files accessible to the web server. Request\n Tracker instances running under Apache or Nginx are not affected.\n* [CVE-2011-1689](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1689)\nRequest Tracker contains multiple cross-site scripting\n vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2011-1690](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1690)\nRequest Tracker enables attackers to redirect authentication\n credentials supplied by legitimate users to third-party servers.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.6.7-5+lenny6 of the request-tracker3.6 package.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.8.8-7+squeeze1 of the request-tracker3.8 package.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.8.10-1 of the\nrequest-tracker3.8 package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Request Tracker packages.\n\n\n",
