The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-4554](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4554)\nSquirrelMail did not prevent page rendering inside a third-party\n HTML frame, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct\n clickjacking attacks via a crafted web site.\n* [CVE-2010-4555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4555), \n [CVE-2011-2752](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2752), \n [CVE-2011-2753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2753)\nMultiple small bugs in SquirrelMail allowed an attacker to inject\n malicious script into various pages or alter the contents of user\n preferences.\n* [CVE-2011-2023](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2023)\nIt was possible to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a\n crafted STYLE element in an HTML part of an e-mail message.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.15-4+lenny5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.21-2.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems\nhave been fixed in version 1.4.22-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail packages.\n\n\n",
