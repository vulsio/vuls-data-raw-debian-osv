	"details": "\nIt has been discovered that the Quagga routing daemon contains two\ndenial-of-service vulnerabilities in its BGP implementation:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-1674](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1674)\nA crafted Extended Communities attribute triggers a NULL\n pointer dereference which causes the BGP daemon to crash.\n The crafted attributes are not propagated by the Internet\n core, so only explicitly configured direct peers are able\n to exploit this vulnerability in typical configurations.\n* [CVE-2010-1675](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1675)\nThe BGP daemon resets BGP sessions when it encounters\n malformed AS\\_PATHLIMIT attributes, introducing a distributed\n BGP session reset vulnerability which disrupts packet\n forwarding. Such malformed attributes are propagated by the\n Internet core, and exploitation of this vulnerability is not\n restricted to directly configured BGP peers.\n\n\nThis security update removes AS\\_PATHLIMIT processing from the BGP\nimplementation, preserving the configuration statements for backwards\ncompatibility. (Standardization of this BGP extension was abandoned\nlong ago.)\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.99.10-1lenny5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.99.17-2+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.\n\n\n",
