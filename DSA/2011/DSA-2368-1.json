	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd, a small and fast\nwebserver with minimal memory footprint.\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-4362](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4362)\nXi Wang discovered that the base64 decoding routine which is used to\n decode user input during an HTTP authentication, suffers of a signedness\n issue when processing user input. As a result it is possible to force\n lighttpd to perform an out-of-bounds read which results in Denial of\n Service conditions.\n* [CVE-2011-3389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3389)\nWhen using CBC ciphers on an SSL enabled virtual host to communicate with\n certain client, a so called BEAST attack allows man-in-the-middle\n attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP traffic via a blockwise\n chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session. Technically this is\n no lighttpd vulnerability. However, lighttpd offers a workaround to\n mitigate this problem by providing a possibility to disable CBC ciphers.\n\n\nThis updates includes this option by default. System administrators\n are advised to read the NEWS file of this update (as this may break older\n clients).\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.19-5+lenny3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.30-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.\n\n\n",
