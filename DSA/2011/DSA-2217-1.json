	"summary": "dhcp3 - missing input sanitizing",
	"details": "\nSebastian Krahmer and Marius Tomaschewski discovered that dhclient of\ndhcp3, a DHCP client, is not properly filtering shell meta-characters\nin certain options in DHCP server responses. These options are reused in\nan insecure fashion by dhclient scripts. This allows an attacker to execute\narbitrary commands with the privileges of such a process by sending crafted\nDHCP options to a client using a rogue server.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.1.1-6+lenny5.\n\n\nFor the stable (squeeze), testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions,\nthis problem has been fixed in an additional update for isc-dhcp.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dhcp3 packages.\n\n\n",
