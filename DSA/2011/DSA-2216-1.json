	"summary": "isc-dhcp - missing input sanitizing",
	"details": "\nSebastian Krahmer and Marius Tomaschewski discovered that dhclient of\nisc-dhcp, a DHCP client, is not properly filtering shell meta-characters\nin certain options in DHCP server responses. These options are reused in\nan insecure fashion by dhclient scripts. This allows an attacker to execute\narbitrary commands with the privileges of such a process by sending crafted\nDHCP options to a client using a rogue server.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nadditional update for dhcp3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.1.1-P1-16.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.\n\n\n",
