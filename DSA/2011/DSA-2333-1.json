	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpLDAPadmin, a web based\ninterface for administering LDAP servers. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-4074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4074)\nInput appended to the URL in cmd.php (when cmd is set to \\_debug) is\n not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be\n exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser\n session in context of an affected site.\n* [CVE-2011-4075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4075)\nInput passed to the orderby parameter in cmd.php (when cmd is set to\n query\\_engine, query is set to none, and search is set to e.g.\n 1) is not properly sanitised in lib/functions.php before being used in a\n create\\_function() function call. This can be exploited to inject and\n execute arbitrary PHP code.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1.0.5-6+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.0.5-2+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.0.5-2.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpldapadmin packages.\n\n\n",
