	"summary": "curl - improper delegation of client credentials",
	"details": "\nRichard Silverman discovered that when doing GSSAPI authentication, libcurl\nunconditionally performs credential delegation. This hands the server a copy of\nthe client's security credentials, allowing the server to impersonate the\nclient to any other using the same GSSAPI mechanism.\nThis is obviously a very sensitive operation, which should only be done when\nthe user explicitly so directs.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.18.2-8lenny5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.21.0-2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.21.6-2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.21.6-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\n",
