	"summary": "dpkg - directory traversal",
	"details": "\nJakub Wilk discovered that the dpkg-source component of dpkg, the Debian\npackage management system, doesn't correctly handle paths in patches of\nsource packages, which could make it traverse directories.\nRaphaÃ«l Hertzog additionally discovered that symbolic links in the .pc\ndirectory are followed, which could make it traverse directories too.\n\n\nBoth issues only affect source packages using the \"3.0 quilt\" format at\nunpack-time.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.14.31.\n\n\nFor the testing (squeeze) and unstable distributions (sid),\nthese problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: [https://www.debian.org/security/]($(HOME)/security/)\n\n\n",
