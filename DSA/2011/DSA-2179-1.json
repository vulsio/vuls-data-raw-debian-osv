The default is not\nto include cleartext passwords.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.29.17-1+lenny1.\n\n\nThe stable distribution (squeeze) and the testing distribution\n(wheezy) do not contain any dtc packages.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.32.10-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dtc packages.\n\n\n",
