An additional\nissue in argument parsing allows denial of service.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.1-6.1+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon\n(the impact in sid is limited to denial of service for both issues).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pam packages.\n\n\n",
