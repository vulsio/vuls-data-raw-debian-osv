(The version in lenny is not affected by this\n problem.)\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.1-17lenny9.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.3a-6squeeze4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.4~rc3-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.\n\n\n",
