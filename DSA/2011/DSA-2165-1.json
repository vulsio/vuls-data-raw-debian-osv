	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg coders, which are used\nby MPlayer and other applications.\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-3429](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3429)\nCesar Bernardini and Felipe Andres Manzano reported an arbitrary offset \n dereference vulnerability in the libavcodec, in particular in the FLIC file \n format parser. A specific FLIC file may exploit this vulnerability and execute\n arbitrary code. Mplayer is also affected by this problem, as well as other \n software that use this library.\n* [CVE-2010-4704](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4704)\nGreg Maxwell discovered an integer overflow the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg. A \n specific Ogg file may exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2010-4705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4705)\nA potential integer overflow has been discovered in the Vorbis decoder in \n FFmpeg.\n\n\nThis upload also fixes an incomplete patch from DSA-2000-1. Michael Gilbert \nnoticed that there was remaining vulnerabilities, which may cause a denial of \nservice and potentially execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.svn20080206-18+lenny3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg-debian packages.\n\n\n",
