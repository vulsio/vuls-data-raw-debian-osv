	"details": "\nSeveral weak certificates were issued by Malaysian intermediate CA\nDigicert Sdn. Bhd. This event, along with other issues, has lead to\nEntrust Inc. and Verizon Cybertrust to revoke the CA's cross-signed\ncertificates.\n\n\nThis update to OpenSSL, a Secure Sockets Layer toolkit, reflects this\ndecision by marking Digicert Sdn. Bhd.'s certificates as revoked.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.8g-15+lenny14.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.8o-4squeeze4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.0e-2.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\n",
