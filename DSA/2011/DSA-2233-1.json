The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-2939](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2939)\nThe postinst script grants the postfix user write access to\n /var/spool/postfix/pid, which might allow local users to\n conduct symlink attacks that overwrite arbitrary files.\n* [CVE-2011-0411](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0411)\nThe STARTTLS implementation does not properly restrict I/O\n buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert\n commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext\n command that is processed after TLS is in place.\n* [CVE-2011-1720](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1720)\nA heap-based read-only buffer overflow allows malicious\n clients to crash the smtpd server process using a crafted SASL\n authentication request.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.5.5-1.1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.7.1-1+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.8.0-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your postfix packages.\n\n\n",
