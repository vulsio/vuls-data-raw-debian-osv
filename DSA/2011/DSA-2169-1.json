	"summary": "telepathy-gabble - missing input validation",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that telepathy-gabble, the Jabber/XMPP connection manager\nfor the Telepathy framework, is processing google:jingleinfo updates without\nvalidating their origin. This may allow an attacker to trick telepathy-gabble\ninto relaying streamed media data through a server of his choice and thus\nintercept audio and video calls.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.7.6-1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.15-1+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your telepathy-gabble packages.\n\n\n",
