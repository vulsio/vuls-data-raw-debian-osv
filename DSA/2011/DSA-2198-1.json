	"summary": "tex-common - insufficient input sanitizing",
	"details": "\nMathias Svensson discovered that tex-common, a package shipping a number\nof scripts and configuration files necessary for TeX, contains insecure\nsettings for the shell\\_escape\\_commands directive. Depending on the\nscenario, this may result in arbitrary code execution when a victim is\ntricked into processing a malicious tex-file or this is done in an\nautomated fashion.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem due\nto shell\\_escape being disabled.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.08.1.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tex-common packages.\n\n\n",
