However, it was discovered that\n this exception can be exploited with a combination of browser plugins\n and redirects and thus is not sufficient.\n* [CVE-2011-0697](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0697)\nIt was discovered that the file upload form is prone to cross-site\n scripting attacks via the file name.\n\n\nIt is important to note that this update introduces minor backward\nincompatibilities due to the fixes for the above issues.\nFor the exact details, please see: \nand in particular the Backwards incompatible changes section.\n\n\nPackages in the oldstable distribution (lenny) are not affected by these\nproblems.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.3-3+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.5-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\n",
