	"details": "\nIssues were found in the handling of XML encryption in simpleSAMLphp,\nan application for federated authentication. The following two issues\nhave been addressed:\n\n\nIt may be possible to use an SP as an oracle to decrypt encrypted\nmessages sent to that SP.\n\n\nIt may be possible to use the SP as a key oracle which can be used\nto forge messages from that SP by issuing 300000-2000000 queries to\nthe SP. \n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain simplesamlphp.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.3-2.\n\n\nThe testing distribution (wheezy) will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your simplesamlphp packages.\n\n\n",
