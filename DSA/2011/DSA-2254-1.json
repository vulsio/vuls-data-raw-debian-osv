	"details": "\nOProfile is a performance profiling tool which is configurable by opcontrol, its\ncontrol utility. Stephane Chauveau reported several ways to inject arbitrary\ncommands in the arguments of this utility. If a local unprivileged user is\nauthorized by sudoers file to run opcontrol as root, this user could use the\nflaw to escalate his privileges.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.3-2+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.6-1.1+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.6-1.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.6-1.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your oprofile packages.\n\n\n",
