Debian, like other software\ndistributors, has as a precaution decided to disable the DigiNotar\nRoot CA by default in its ca-certificates bundle.\n\n\nFor other software in Debian that ships a CA bundle, like the\nMozilla suite, updates are forthcoming.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), the ca-certificates package\ndoes not contain this root CA.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), the root CA has been\ndisabled starting ca-certificates version 20090814+nmu3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution\n(sid), the root CA has been disabled starting ca-certificates\nversion 20110502+nmu1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ca-certificates packages.\n\n\n",
