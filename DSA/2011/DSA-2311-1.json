	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an\nimplementation of the Java SE platform. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-0862](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0862)\nInteger overflow errors in the JPEG and font parser allow\n untrusted code (including applets) to elevate its privileges.\n* [CVE-2011-0864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0864)\nHotspot, the just-in-time compiler in OpenJDK, mishandled\n certain byte code instructions, allowing untrusted code\n (including applets) to crash the virtual machine.\n* [CVE-2011-0865](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0865)\nA race condition in signed object deserialization could\n allow untrusted code to modify signed content, apparently\n leaving its signature intact.\n* [CVE-2011-0867](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0867)\nUntrusted code (including applets) could access information\n about network interfaces which was not intended to be public.\n (Note that the interface MAC address is still available to\n untrusted code.)\n* [CVE-2011-0868](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0868)\nA float-to-long conversion could overflow, allowing\n untrusted code (including applets) to crash the virtual\n machine.\n* [CVE-2011-0869](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0869)\nUntrusted code (including applets) could intercept HTTP\n requests by reconfiguring proxy settings through a SOAP\n connection.\n* [CVE-2011-0871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0871)\nUntrusted code (including applets) could elevate its\n privileges through the Swing MediaTracker code.\n\n\nIn addition, this update removes support for the Zero/Shark and Cacao\nHotspot variants from the i386 and amd64 due to stability issues.\nThese Hotspot variants are included in the openjdk-6-jre-zero and\nicedtea-6-jre-cacao packages, and these packages must be removed\nduring this update.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems will be fixed\nin a separate DSA for technical reasons.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 6b18-1.8.9-0.1~squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 6b18-1.8.9-0.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.\n\n\n",
