	"details": "\nIt has been discovered that xml-security-c, an implementation of the XML\nDigital Signature and Encryption specifications, is not properly handling\nRSA keys of sizes on the order of 8192 or more bits. This allows an\nattacker to crash applications using this functionality or potentially\nexecute arbitrary code by tricking an application into verifying a signature\ncreated with a sufficiently long RSA key.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.0-3+lenny3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.5.1-3+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xml-security-c packages.\n\n\n",
