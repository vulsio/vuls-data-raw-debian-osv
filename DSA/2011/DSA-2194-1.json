	"details": "\nIt was discovered that libvirt, a library for interfacing with different\nvirtualization systems, did not properly check for read-only connections.\nThis allowed a local attacker to perform a denial of service (crash) or\npossibly escalate privileges.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.3-5+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.8-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.\n\n\n",
