	"details": "\nDominik George discovered that Logwatch does not guard against shell\nmeta-characters in crafted log file names (such as those produced by\nSamba). As a result, an attacker might be able to execute shell\ncommands on the system running Logwatch.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.3.6.cvs20080702-2lenny1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.3.6.cvs20090906-1squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 7.3.6.cvs20090906-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your logwatch packages.\n\n\n",
