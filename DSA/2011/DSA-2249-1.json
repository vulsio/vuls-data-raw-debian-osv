	"summary": "jabberd14 - denial of service",
	"details": "\nWouter Coekaerts discovered that jabberd14, an instant messaging server\nusing the Jabber/XMPP protocol, is vulnerable to the so-called\nbillion laughs attack because it does not prevent entity expansion on\nreceived data. This allows an attacker to perform denial of service\nattacks against the service by sending specially crafted XML data to it.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny), does not contain jabberd14.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.1.1-5+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.1.1-5.1\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your jabberd14 packages.\n\n\n",
