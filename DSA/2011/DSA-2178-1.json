	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Pango did not check for memory allocation\nfailures, causing a NULL pointer dereference with an adjustable\noffset. This can lead to application crashes and potentially\narbitrary code execution.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.28.3-1+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),\nthis problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pango1.0 packages.\n\n\n",
