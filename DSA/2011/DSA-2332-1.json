	"details": "\nPaul McMillan, Mozilla and the Django core team discovered several\nvulnerabilities in Django, a Python web framework:\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-4136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4136)\nWhen using memory-based sessions and caching, Django sessions are\n stored directly in the root namespace of the cache. When user data is\n stored in the same cache, a remote user may take over a session.\n* [CVE-2011-4137](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4137), [CVE-2011-4138](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4138)\nDjango's field type URLfield by default checks supplied URL's by\n issuing a request to it, which doesn't time out. A Denial of Service\n is possible by supplying specially prepared URL's that keep the\n connection open indefinately or fill the Django's server memory.\n* [CVE-2011-4139](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4139)\nDjango used X-Forwarded-Host headers to construct full URL's. This\n header may not contain trusted input and could be used to poison the\n cache.\n* [CVE-2011-4140](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4140)\nThe CSRF protection mechanism in Django does not properly handle\n web-server configurations supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers,\n which allows remote attackers to trigger unauthenticated forged\n requests.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-1+lenny3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.3-3+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem\nhas been fixed in version 1.3.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\n",
