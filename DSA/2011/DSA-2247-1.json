The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-0446](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0446)\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when JavaScript\n encoding is used, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web\n script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2011-0447](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0447)\nRails does not properly validate HTTP requests that contain an\n X-Requested-With header, which makes it easier for remote attackers\n to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.0-7+lenny0.1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze0.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.11-0.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.\n\n\n",
