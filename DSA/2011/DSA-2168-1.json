Due to a technical problem with the\nbuildd infrastructure the update is not yet available, but will be\ninstalled into the archive soon.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.12.1+dfsg-4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.14+dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages. Note that in order\nto apply this security update, you must rebuild the OpenAFS kernel module. \n\n\n",
