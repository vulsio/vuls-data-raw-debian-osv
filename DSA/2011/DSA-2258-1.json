	"details": "\nIt was discovered that the STARTTLS implementation of the\nKolab Cyrus IMAP server does not properly restrict I/O buffering,\nwhich allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted\nIMAP, LMTP, NNTP and POP3 sessions by sending a cleartext command that is\nprocessed after TLS is in place.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.13-5+lenny3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.13-9.1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.13p1-0.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.13p1-0.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kolab-cyrus-imapd packages.\n\n\n",
