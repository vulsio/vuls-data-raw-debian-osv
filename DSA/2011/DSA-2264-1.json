Users with physical access can gain access to sensitive kernel\n memory by adding a storage device with a specially crafted corrupted\n invalid partition table.\n* [CVE-2011-2022](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2022)\nVasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.\n Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service due\n to missing bounds checking in the AGPIOC\\_UNBIND ioctl. On default Debian\n installations, this is exploitable only by users in the video group.\n* [CVE-2011-2182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2182)\nBen Hutchings reported an issue with the fix for [CVE-2011-1017](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1017) (see above)\n that made it insufficient to resolve the issue.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.26-26lenny3. Updates for arm and hppa are not yet available,\nbut will be released as soon as possible.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 5.0 (lenny) |\n| --- | --- |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.26-1um-2+26lenny3 |\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.\nThese updates will not become active until after your system is rebooted.\n\n\nNote: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every\nLinux kernel package in all releases under active security support.\nHowever, given the high frequency at which low-severity security\nissues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of\ndoing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not\nbe released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be\nreleased in a staggered or leap-frog fashion.\n\n\n",
