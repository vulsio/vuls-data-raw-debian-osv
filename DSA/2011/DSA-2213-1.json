	"details": "\nSebastian Krahmer discovered that the xrdb utility of x11-xserver-utils,\na X server resource database utility, is not properly filtering crafted\nhostnames. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with\nroot privileges given that either remote logins via xdmcp are allowed or\nthe attacker is able to place a rogue DHCP server into the victims network.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.3+6.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.5+3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.6+2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your x11-xserver-utils packages.\n\n\n",
