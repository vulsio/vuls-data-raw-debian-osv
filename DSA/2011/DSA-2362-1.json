This issue doesn't affect oldstable. The\n script is only shipped as an example in /usr/share/doc/acpid/examples.\n See /usr/share/doc/acpid/README.Debian for details.\n* [CVE-2011-4578](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4578)\nHelmut Grohne and Michael Biebl discovered that acpid sets a umask\n of 0 when executing scripts, which could result in local privilege\n escalation.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.8-1lenny4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.0.7-1squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your acpid packages.\n\n\n",
