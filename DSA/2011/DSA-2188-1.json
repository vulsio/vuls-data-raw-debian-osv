	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in WebKit, a Web content engine\nlibrary for GTK+. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2010-1783](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1783)\nWebKit does not properly handle dynamic modification of a text node, which \n allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service \n (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML \n document.\n* [CVE-2010-2901](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2901)\nThe rendering implementation in WebKit allows remote attackers to cause a \n denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other \n impact via unknown vectors.\n* [CVE-2010-4199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4199)\nWebKit does not properly perform a cast of an unspecified variable during \n processing of an SVG <use> element, which allows remote attackers to cause a \n denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SVG \n document.\n* [CVE-2010-4040](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4040)\nWebKit does not properly handle animated GIF images, which allows remote \n attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have \n unspecified other impact via a crafted image.\n* [CVE-2010-4492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4492)\nUse-after-free vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to cause a \n denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors \n involving SVG animations.\n* [CVE-2010-4493](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4493)\nUse-after-free vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to cause a\n denial of service via vectors related to the handling of mouse dragging \n events.\n* [CVE-2010-4577](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4577)\nThe CSSParser::parseFontFaceSrc function in WebCore/css/CSSParser.cpp in\n WebKit does not properly parse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences,\n which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds \n read) via a crafted local font, related to Type Confusion.\n* [CVE-2010-4578](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4578)\nWebKit does not properly perform cursor handling, which allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other\n impact via unknown vectors that lead to stale pointers.\n* [CVE-2011-0482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0482)\nWebKit does not properly perform a cast of an unspecified variable during\n handling of anchors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of \n service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted HTML \n document.\n* [CVE-2011-0778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0778)\nWebKit does not properly restrict drag and drop operations, which might \n allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via unspecified \n vectors.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.2.7-0+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),\nthese problems have been fixed in version 1.2.7-1.\n\n\nSecurity support for WebKit has been discontinued for the oldstable \ndistribution (lenny). The current version in oldstable is not supported by \nupstream anymore and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes \nfor these and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we need to\ndrop our security support for the version in oldstable.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your webkit packages.\n\n\n",
