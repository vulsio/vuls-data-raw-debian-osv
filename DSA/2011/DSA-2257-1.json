	"details": "\nRocco Calvi discovered that the XSPF playlist parser of VLC, a multimedia\nplayer and streamer, is prone to an integer overflow resulting in a\nheap-based buffer overflow. This might allow an attacker to execute\narbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted\nfile.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.3-1squeeze6.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this\nproblem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.\n\n\n",
