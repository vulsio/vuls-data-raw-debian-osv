	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Unbound, a caching DNS resolver, ceases to\nprovide answers for zones signed using DNSSEC after it has processed a\ncrafted query. ([CVE-2009-4008](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4008))\n\n\nIn addition, this update improves the level of DNSSEC support in the\nlenny version of Unbound so that it is possible for system\nadministrators to configure the trust anchor for the root zone.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.6-1~lenny1.\n\n\nFor the other distributions (squeeze, wheezy, sid), this problem has\nbeen fixed in version 1.4.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unbound packages.\n\n\n",
