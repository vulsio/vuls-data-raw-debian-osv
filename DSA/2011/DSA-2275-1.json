	"details": "\nWill Dormann and Jared Allar discovered that the Lotus Word Pro import\nfilter of OpenOffice.org, a full-featured office productivity suite that\nprovides a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft Office, is not\nproperly handling object ids in the .lwp file format. An attacker can\nexploit this with a specially crafted file and execute arbitrary code with\nthe rights of the victim importing the file.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:3.2.1-11+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nlibreoffice version 1:3.3.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.\n\n\n",
