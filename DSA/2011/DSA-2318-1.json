	"details": "\nMultiple security issues have been discovered in cyrus-imapd, a highly scalable\nmail system designed for use in enterprise environments. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-3208](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3208)\nCoverity discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the NNTP server\n implementation (nttpd) of cyrus-imapd. An attacker can exploit this\n flaw via several crafted NNTP commands to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2011-3372](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3372)\nStefan Cornelius of Secunia Research discovered that the command processing\n of the NNTP server implementation (nttpd) of cyrus-imapd is not properly\n implementing access restrictions for certain commands and is not checking\n for a complete, successful authentication. An attacker can use this flaw\n to bypass access restrictions for some commands and, e.g. exploit\n [CVE-2011-3208](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3208) without proper authentication.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2\\_2.2.13-14+lenny5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2\\_2.2.13-19+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\ncyrus-imapd-2.4 version 2.4.12-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.\n\n\n",
