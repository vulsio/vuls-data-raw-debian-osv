	"summary": "apr - denial of service",
	"details": "\nA flaw was found in the APR library, which could be exploited through\nApache HTTPD's mod\\_autoindex. If a directory indexed by mod\\_autoindex\ncontained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could\nsend a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU\nusage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.12-5+lenny3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.2-6+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed in\nversion 1.4.4-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apr packages and restart the\napache2 server.\n\n\n",
