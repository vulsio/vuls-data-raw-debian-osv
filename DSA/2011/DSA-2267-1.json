	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Perl's Safe module - a module to compile and\nexecute code in restricted compartments - could be bypassed.\n\n\nPlease note that this update is known to break Petal, an XML-based\ntemplating engine (shipped with Debian 6.0/Squeeze in the package\nlibpetal-perl, see \n[\\\nbug #582805](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=582805) for details). A fix is not yet available. If you use Petal, you \nmight consider to put the previous Perl packages on hold.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.10.0-19lenny5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.10.1-17squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.12.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.\n\n\n",
