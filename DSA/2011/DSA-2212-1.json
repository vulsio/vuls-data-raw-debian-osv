	"details": "\nDaniel Danner discovered that tmux, a terminal multiplexer, is not\nproperly dropping group privileges. Due to a patch introduced by Debian,\nwhen invoked with the -S option, tmux is not dropping permissions obtained\nthrough its setgid installation.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem,\nas it does not include tmux.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3-2+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4-6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tmux packages.\n\n\n",
