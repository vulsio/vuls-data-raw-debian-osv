	"details": "\nIt was discovered that the W3C XML Signature recommendation contains a\nprotocol-level vulnerability related to HMAC output truncation. This\nupdate implements the proposed workaround in the C++ version of the\nApache implementation of this standard, xml-security-c, by preventing\ntruncation to output strings shorter than 80 bits or half of the\noriginal HMAC output, whichever is greater.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.1-3+etch1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.0-3+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.0-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xml-security-c packages.\n\n\n",
