The Debian packages\n currently do not support Java Web Start, so these issues are not\n directly exploitable, but the relevant code has been updated\n nevertheless.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 9.1+lenny2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.\n\n\n",
