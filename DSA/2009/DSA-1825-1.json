Input to the ping and traceroute parameters\nof the script is not properly validated which allows an attacker to execute\narbitrary shell commands by passing a crafted value to these parameters.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6-2+etch3 of nagios2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.0.6-4~lenny2 of nagios3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.0.6-5 of nagios3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.0.6-5 of nagios3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nagios2/nagios3 packages.\n\n\n",
