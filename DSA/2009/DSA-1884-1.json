	"summary": "nginx - arbitrary code execution",
	"details": "\nChris Ries discovered that nginx, a high-performance HTTP server, reverse\nproxy and IMAP/POP3 proxy server, is vulnerable to a buffer underflow when\nprocessing certain HTTP requests. An attacker can use this to execute\narbitrary code with the rights of the worker process (www-data on Debian)\nor possibly perform denial of service attacks by repeatedly crashing\nworker processes via a specially crafted URL in an HTTP request.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.4.13-2+etch2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.6.32-3+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.7.61-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.\n\n\n",
