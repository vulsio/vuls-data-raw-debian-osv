	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in drupal6, a fully-featured\ncontent management framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-2372](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2372)\nGerhard Killesreiter discovered a flaw in the way user signatures are\nhandled. It is possible for a user to inject arbitrary code via a\ncrafted user signature. (SA-CORE-2009-007)\n* [CVE-2009-2373](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2373)\nMark Piper, Sven Herrmann and Brandon Knight discovered a cross-site\nscripting issue in the forum module, which could be exploited via the\ntid parameter. (SA-CORE-2009-007)\n* [CVE-2009-2374](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2374)\nSumit Datta discovered that certain drupal6 pages leak sensitive\ninformation such as user credentials. (SA-CORE-2009-007)\n\n\nSeveral design flaws in the OpenID module have been fixed, which could\nlead to cross-site request forgeries or privilege escalations. Also, the\nfile upload function does not process all extensions properly leading\nto the possible execution of arbitrary code.\n(SA-CORE-2009-008)\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain drupal6.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 6.6-3lenny3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 6.14-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 packages.\n\n\n",
