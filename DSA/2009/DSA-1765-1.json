	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in horde3, the horde web application\nframework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-0932](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0932)\nGunnar Wrobel discovered a directory traversal vulnerability, which\nallows attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via the\ndriver parameter in Horde\\_Image.\n* [CVE-2008-3330](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3330)\nIt was discovered that an attacker could perform a cross-site scripting\nattack via the contact name, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary\nhtml code. This requires that the attacker has access to create\ncontacts.\n* [CVE-2008-5917](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5917)\nIt was discovered that the horde XSS filter is prone to a cross-site\nscripting attack, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary html code.\nThis is only exploitable when Internet Explorer is used.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.1.3-4etch5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.2.2+debian0-2, which was already included in the lenny\nrelease.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.2.2+debian0-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your horde3 packages.\n\n\n",
