	"details": "\nA vulnerability has been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead\nto privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problem:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-2692](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2692)\nTavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes discovered an issue with how the\n sendpage function is initialized in the proto\\_ops structure.\n Local users can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated\n privileges.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.8etch3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.\n\n\nNote: Debian 'etch' includes linux kernel packages based upon both the\n2.6.18 and 2.6.24 linux releases. All known security issues are\ncarefully tracked against both packages and both packages will receive\nsecurity updates until security support for Debian 'etch'\nconcludes. However, given the high frequency at which low-severity\nsecurity issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource\nrequirements of doing an update, lower severity 2.6.18 and 2.6.24\nupdates will typically release in a staggered or \"leap-frog\" fashion.\n\n\n",
