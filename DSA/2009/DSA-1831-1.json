	"details": "\nMatthew Dempsky discovered that Daniel J. Bernstein's djbdns, a Domain\nName System server, does not constrain offsets in the required manner,\nwhich allows remote attackers with control over a third-party subdomain\nserved by tinydns and axfrdns, to trigger DNS responses containing\narbitrary records via crafted zone data for this subdomain.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (etch) does not contain djbdns.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.05-4+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.05-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your djbdns package.\n\n\n",
