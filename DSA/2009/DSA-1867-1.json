	"details": "\nSeveral security issues have been discovered in kdelibs, core libraries\nfrom the official KDE release. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-1690](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1690)\nIt was discovered that there is a use-after-free flaw in handling\ncertain DOM event handlers. This could lead to the execution of\narbitrary code, when visiting a malicious website.\n* [CVE-2009-1698](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1698)\nIt was discovered that there could be an uninitialised pointer when\nhandling a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attr function call. This could\nlead to the execution of arbitrary code, when visiting a malicious\nwebsite.\n* [CVE-2009-1687](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1687)\nIt was discovered that the JavaScript garbage collector does not handle\nallocation failures properly, which could lead to the execution of\narbitrary code when visiting a malicious website.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 4:3.5.5a.dfsg.1-8etch2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4:3.5.10.dfsg.1-0lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs packages.\n\n\n",
