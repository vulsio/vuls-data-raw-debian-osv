	"details": "\nIt was discovered that znc, an IRC proxy/bouncer, does not properly\nsanitize input contained in configuration change requests to the\nwebadmin interface. This allows authenticated users to elevate their\nprivileges and indirectly execute arbitrary commands ([CVE-2009-0759](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0759)).\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.045-3+etch2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.058-2+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.066-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your znc packages.\n\n\n",
