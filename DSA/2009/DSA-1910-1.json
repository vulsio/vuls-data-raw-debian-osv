	"summary": "mysql-ocaml - missing escape function",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that mysql-ocaml, OCaml bindings for MySql, was\nmissing a function to call mysql\\_real\\_escape\\_string(). This is needed,\nbecause mysql\\_real\\_escape\\_string() honours the charset of the connection\nand prevents insufficient escaping, when certain multibyte character\nencodings are used. The added function is called real\\_escape() and\ntakes the established database connection as a first argument. The old\nescape\\_string() was kept for backwards compatibility.\n\n\nDevelopers using these bindings are encouraged to adjust their code to\nuse the new function.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.4-2+etch1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.4-4+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql-ocaml packages.\n\n\n",
