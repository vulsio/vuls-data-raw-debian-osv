	"details": "\nIt was discovered that BIND, an implementation of the DNS protocol\nsuite, does not properly check the result of an OpenSSL function which\nis used to verify DSA cryptographic signatures. As a result,\nincorrect DNS resource records in zones protected by DNSSEC could be\naccepted as genuine.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 9.3.4-2etch4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution\n(lenny), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your BIND packages.\n\n\n",
