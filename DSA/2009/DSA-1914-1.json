	"summary": "mapserver - serveral vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in mapserver, a CGI-based\nweb framework to publish spatial data and interactive mapping applications.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-0843](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0843)\nMissing input validation on a user supplied map queryfile name can be\n used by an attacker to check for the existence of a specific file by\n using the queryfile GET parameter and checking for differences in error\n messages.\n* [CVE-2009-0842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0842)\nA lack of file type verification when parsing a map file can lead to\n partial disclosure of content from arbitrary files through parser error\n messages.\n* [CVE-2009-0841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0841)\nDue to missing input validation when saving map files under certain\n conditions it is possible to perform directory traversal attacks and\n to create arbitrary files.\n NOTE: Unless the attacker is able to create directories in the image\n path or there is already a readable directory this doesn't affect\n installations on Linux as the fopen() syscall will fail in case a sub\n path is not readable.\n* [CVE-2009-0839](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0839)\nIt was discovered that mapserver is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer\n overflow when processing certain GET parameters. An attacker can use\n this to execute arbitrary code on the server via crafted id parameters.\n* [CVE-2009-0840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0840)\nAn integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when\n processing the Content-Length header of an HTTP request can be used by an\n attacker to execute arbitrary code via crafted POST requests containing\n negative Content-Length values.\n* [CVE-2009-2281](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2281)\nAn integer overflow when processing HTTP requests can lead to a\n heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker can use this to execute arbitrary\n code either via crafted Content-Length values or large HTTP request. This\n is partly because of an incomplete fix for\n [CVE-2009-0840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0840).\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.10.0-5.1+etch4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.0.3-3+lenny4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.4.2-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.4.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mapserver packages.\n\n\n",
