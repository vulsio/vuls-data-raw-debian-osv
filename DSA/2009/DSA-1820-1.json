	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a\nruntime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web\nbrowser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-1392](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1392)\nSeveral issues in the browser engine have been discovered, which can\nresult in the execution of arbitrary code. (MFSA 2009-24)\n* [CVE-2009-1832](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1832)\nIt is possible to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving \"double\nframe construction.\" (MFSA 2009-24)\n* [CVE-2009-1833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1833)\nJesse Ruderman and Adam Hauner discovered a problem in the JavaScript\nengine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n(MFSA 2009-24)\n* [CVE-2009-1834](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1834)\nPavel Cvrcek discovered a potential issue leading to a spoofing attack\non the location bar related to certain invalid unicode characters.\n(MFSA 2009-25)\n* [CVE-2009-1835](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1835)\nGregory Fleischer discovered that it is possible to read arbitrary\ncookies via a crafted HTML document. (MFSA 2009-26)\n* [CVE-2009-1836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1836)\nShuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang and Ming Zhang reported a potential\nman-in-the-middle attack, when using a proxy due to insufficient checks\non a certain proxy response. (MFSA 2009-27)\n* [CVE-2009-1837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1837)\nJakob Balle and Carsten Eiram reported a race condition in the\nNPObjWrapper\\_NewResolve function that can be used to execute arbitrary\ncode. (MFSA 2009-28)\n* [CVE-2009-1838](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1838)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary\nJavaScript with chrome privileges due to an error in the\ngarbage-collection implementation. (MFSA 2009-29)\n* [CVE-2009-1839](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1839)\nAdam Barth and Collin Jackson reported a potential privilege escalation\nwhen loading a file::resource via the location bar. (MFSA 2009-30)\n* [CVE-2009-1840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1840)\nWladimir Palant discovered that it is possible to bypass access\nrestrictions due to a lack of content policy check, when loading a\nscript file into a XUL document. (MFSA 2009-31)\n* [CVE-2009-1841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1841)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 reported that it is possible for scripts from page content\nto run with elevated privileges and thus potentially executing arbitrary\ncode with the object's chrome privileges. (MFSA 2009-32)\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.0.11-0lenny1.\n\n\nAs indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the\nMozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped\nbefore the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.\nYou are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still\nsupported browser.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed\nsoon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.0.11-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.\n\n\n",
