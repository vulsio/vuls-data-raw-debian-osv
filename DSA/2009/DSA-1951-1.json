	"details": "\nIt was discovered that firefox-sage, a lightweight RSS and Atom feed\nreader for Firefox, does not sanitise the RSS feed information\ncorrectly, which makes it prone to a cross-site scripting and a\ncross-domain scripting attack.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.6-4etch1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.2-0.1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.3-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your firefox-sage packages.\n\n\n",
