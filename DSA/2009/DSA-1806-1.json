	"summary": "cscope - arbitrary code execution",
	"details": "\nMatt Murphy discovered that cscope, a source code browsing tool, does not\nverify the length of file names sourced in include statements, which may\npotentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code through specially\ncrafted source code files.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 15.6-6+lenny1.\n\n\nDue to a technical limitation in the Debian archive management scripts\nthe update for the old stable distribution (etch) cannot be released\nsynchronously. It will be fixed in version 15.6-2+etch1 soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cscope package.\n\n\n",
