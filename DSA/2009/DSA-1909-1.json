	"summary": "postgresql-ocaml - missing escape function",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that postgresql-ocaml, OCaml bindings to PostgreSQL's\nlibpq, was missing a function to call PQescapeStringConn(). This is\nneeded, because PQescapeStringConn() honours the charset of the\nconnection and prevents insufficient escaping, when certain multibyte\ncharacter encodings are used. The added function is called\nescape\\_string\\_conn() and takes the established database connection as a\nfirst argument. The old escape\\_string() was kept for backwards\ncompatibility.\n\n\nDevelopers using these bindings are encouraged to adjust their code to\nuse the new function.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.5.4-2+etch1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.7.0-3+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.12.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-ocaml packages.\n\n\n",
