The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-0500](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0500)\nIt was discovered that the information stored in the log tables\n was not properly sanitized, which could allow attackers to inject\n arbitrary web code.\n* [CVE-2009-0502](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0502)\nIt was discovered that certain input via the \"Login as\" function\n was not properly sanitised leading to the injection of arbitrary\n web script.\n* [CVE-2008-5153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5153)\nDmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that the SpellCheker plugin creates\n temporary files insecurely, allowing a denial of service attack.\n Since the plugin was unused, it is removed in this update.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.3-2+etch2.\n\n\nFor the testing (lenny) distribution these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.8.2.dfsg-3+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable (sid) distribution these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.8.2.dfsg-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your moodle package.\n\n\n",
