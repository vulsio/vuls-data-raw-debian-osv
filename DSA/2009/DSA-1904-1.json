	"summary": "wget - SSL certificate verification weakness",
	"details": "\nDaniel Stenberg discovered that wget, a network utility to retrieve files from\nthe Web using HTTP(S) and FTP, is vulnerable to the \"Null Prefix Attacks Against\nSSL/TLS Certificates\" published at the Blackhat conference some time ago. This\nallows an attacker to perform undetected man-in-the-middle attacks via a crafted\nITU-T X.509 certificate with an injected null byte in the Common Name field.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.10.2-2+etch1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.11.4-2+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.12-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wget packages.\n\n\n",
