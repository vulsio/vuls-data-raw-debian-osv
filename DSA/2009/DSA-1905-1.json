	"summary": "python-django - denial of service",
	"details": "\nThe forms library of python-django, a high-level Python web development\nframework, is using a badly chosen regular expression when validating\nemail addresses and URLs. An attacker can use this to perform denial\nof service attacks (100% CPU consumption) due to bad backtracking\nvia a specially crafted email address or URL which is validated by the\ndjango forms library.\n\n\npython-django in the oldstable distribution (etch), is not affected by\nthis problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-1+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\n",
