	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in racoon, the Internet Key\nExchange daemon of ipsec-tools. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-1574](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1574)\nNeil Kettle discovered a NULL pointer dereference on crafted fragmented packets\nthat contain no payload. This results in the daemon crashing which can be used\nfor denial of service attacks.\n* [CVE-2009-1632](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1632)\nVarious memory leaks in the X.509 certificate authentication handling and the\nNAT-Traversal keepalive implementation can result in memory exhaustion and\nthus denial of service.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.6.6-3.1etch3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.7.1-1.3+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:0.7.1-1.5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ipsec-tools packages.\n\n\n",
