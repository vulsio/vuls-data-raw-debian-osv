	"details": "\nIt was discovered that OpenLDAP, a free implementation of the Lightweight\nDirectory Access Protocol, when OpenSSL is used, does not properly handle a '\\0'\ncharacter in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509\ncertificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL\nservers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version\n2.3.30-5+etch3 for openldap2.3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version\n2.4.11-1+lenny1 for openldap.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),\nthis problem has been fixed in version 2.4.17-2.1 for openldap.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openldap2.3/openldap packages.\n\n\n",
