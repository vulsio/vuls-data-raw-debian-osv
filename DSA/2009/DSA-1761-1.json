	"details": "\nChristian J. Eibl discovered that the TeX filter of Moodle, a web-based\ncourse management system, doesn't check user input for certain TeX commands\nwhich allows an attacker to include and display the content of arbitrary system\nfiles.\n\n\nNote that this doesn't affect installations that only use the mimetex\nenvironment.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.3-2+etch3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8.2.dfsg-3+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8.2.dfsg-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your moodle packages.\n\n\n",
