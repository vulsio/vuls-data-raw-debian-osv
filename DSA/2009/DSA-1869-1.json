	"summary": "curl - SSL certificate verification weakness",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that curl, a client and library to get files from servers\nusing HTTP, HTTPS or FTP, is vulnerable to the \"Null Prefix Attacks Against\nSSL/TLS Certificates\" recently published at the Blackhat conference. This\nallows an attacker to perform undetected man-in-the-middle attacks via a\ncrafted ITU-T X.509 certificate with an injected null byte in the Common\nName field.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.15.5-1etch3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.18.2-8lenny3.\n\n\nFor the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\n",
