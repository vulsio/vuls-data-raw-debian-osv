	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in mimetex, a lightweight\nalternative to MathML. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-1382](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1382)\nChris Evans and Damien Miller, discovered multiple stack-based buffer overflow.\nAn attacker could execute arbitrary code via a TeX file with long picture,\ncircle, input tags.\n* [CVE-2009-2459](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2459)\nChris Evans discovered that mimeTeX contained certain directives that may be\nunsuitable for handling untrusted user input. A remote attacker can obtain\nsensitive information.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.50-1+etch1.\n\n\nDue to a bug in the archive system, the fix for the stable distribution\n(lenny) will be released as version 1.50-1+lenny1 once it is available.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),\nthese problems have been fixed in version 1.50-1.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mimetex packages.\n\n\n",
