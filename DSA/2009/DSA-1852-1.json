	"summary": "fetchmail - SSL certificate verification weakness",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that fetchmail, a full-featured remote mail retrieval\nand forwarding utility, is vulnerable to the \"Null Prefix Attacks Against\nSSL/TLS Certificates\" recently published at the Blackhat conference.\nThis allows an attacker to perform undetected man-in-the-middle attacks\nvia a crafted ITU-T X.509 certificate with an injected null byte in the\nsubjectAltName or Common Name fields.\n\n\nNote, as a fetchmail user you should always use strict certificate\nvalidation through either these option combinations:\n sslcertck ssl sslproto ssl3 (for service on SSL-wrapped ports)\nor\n sslcertck sslproto tls1 (for STARTTLS-based services)\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.3.6-1etch2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.3.9~rc2-4+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.3.9~rc2-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your fetchmail packages.\n\n\n",
