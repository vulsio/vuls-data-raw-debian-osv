	"summary": "pidgin - insufficient input sanitization",
	"details": "\nFederico Muttis discovered that libpurple, the shared library that adds\nsupport for various instant messaging networks to the pidgin IM client, is\nvulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. This issue exists because of\nan incomplete fix for [CVE-2008-2927](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2927) and [CVE-2009-1376](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1376). An attacker can\nexploit this by sending two consecutive SLP packets to a victim via MSN.\n\n\nThe first packet is used to create an SLP message object with an offset of\nzero, the second packet then contains a crafted offset which hits the\nvulnerable code originally fixed in [CVE-2008-2927](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2927) and [CVE-2009-1376](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1376) and\nallows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nNote: Users with the \"Allow only the users below\" setting are not vulnerable\nto this attack. If you can't install the below updates you may want to\nset this via Tools->Privacy.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.3-4lenny3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.5.9-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.\n\n\n",
