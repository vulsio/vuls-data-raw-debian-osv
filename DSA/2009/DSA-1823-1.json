	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,\nprint, and login server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-1886](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1886)\nThe smbclient utility contains a formatstring vulnerability where\n commands dealing with file names treat user input as format strings\n to asprintf.\n* [CVE-2009-1888](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1888)\nIn the smbd daemon, if a user is trying to modify an access control\n list (ACL) and is denied permission, this deny may be overridden if\n the parameter \"dos filemode\" is set to \"yes\" in the smb.conf and the\n user already has write access to the file.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.2.5-4lenny6.\n\n\nThe unstable distribution (sid), which is only affected by [CVE-2009-1888](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1888),\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your samba package.\n\n\n",
