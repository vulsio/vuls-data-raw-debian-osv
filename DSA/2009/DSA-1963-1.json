	"summary": "unbound - DNSSEC validation",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Unbound, a DNS resolver, does not properly\ncheck cryptographic signatures on NSEC3 records. As a result, zones\nsigned with the NSEC3 variant of DNSSEC lose their cryptographic\nprotection. (An attacker would still have to carry out an ordinary\ncache poisoning attack to add bad data to the cache.)\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (etch) does not contain an unbound\npackage.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution\n(squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unbound package.\n\n\n",
