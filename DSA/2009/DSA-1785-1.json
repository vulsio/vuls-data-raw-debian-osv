	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark\nnetwork traffic analyzer, which may lead to denial of service or the\nexecution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-1210](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1210)\nA format string vulnerability was discovered in the PROFINET\n dissector.\n* [CVE-2009-1268](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1268)\nThe dissector for the Check Point High-Availability Protocol\n could be forced to crash.\n* [CVE-2009-1269](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1269)\nMalformed Tektronix files could lead to a crash.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (etch), is only affected by the\nCPHAP crash, which doesn't warrant an update on its own. The fix\nwill be queued up for an upcoming security update or a point release.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-3+lenny5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.7-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wireshark packages.\n\n\n",
