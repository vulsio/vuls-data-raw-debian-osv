	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the xmltooling packages,\nas used by Shibboleth:\n\n\n* Chris Ries discovered that decoding a crafted URL leads to a crash (and\npotentially, arbitrary code execution).\n* Ian Young discovered that embedded NUL characters in certificate names\nwere not correctly handled, exposing configurations using PKIX trust\nvalidation to impersonation attacks.\n* Incorrect processing of SAML metadata ignores key usage constraints.\nThis minor issue also needs a correction in the opensaml2 packages,\nwhich will be provided in an upcoming stable point release (and,\nbefore that, via stable-proposed-updates).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0-2+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xmltooling packages.\n\n\n",
