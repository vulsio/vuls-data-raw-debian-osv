	"summary": "git-core - correct build failure introduced in DSA-1841-1",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that git-daemon which is part of git-core, a popular\ndistributed revision control system, is vulnerable to denial of service\nattacks caused by a programming mistake in handling requests containing\nextra unrecognized arguments which results in an infinite loop. While\nthis is no problem for the daemon itself as every request will spawn a\nnew git-daemon instance, this still results in a very high CPU consumption\nand might lead to denial of service conditions.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.4.4-4+etch3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.5.6.5-3+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:1.6.3.3-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:1.6.3.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your git-core packages.\n\n\n",
