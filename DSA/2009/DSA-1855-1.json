	"summary": "subversion - heap overflow",
	"details": "\nMatt Lewis discovered that Subversion performs insufficient input\nvalidation of svndiff streams. Malicious servers could cause heap\noverflows in clients, and malicious clients with commit access could\ncause heap overflows in servers, possibly leading to arbitrary code\nexecution in both cases.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.2dfsg1-3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.5.1dfsg1-4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.4dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Subversion packages.\n\n\n",
