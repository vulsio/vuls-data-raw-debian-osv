	"summary": "curl - arbitrary file access",
	"details": "\nDavid Kierznowski discovered that libcurl, a multi-protocol file transfer\nlibrary, when configured to follow URL redirects automatically, does not\nquestion the new target location. As libcurl also supports file:// and\nscp:// URLs - depending on the setup - an untrusted server could use that\nto expose local files, overwrite local files or even execute arbitrary\ncode via a malicious URL redirect.\n\n\nThis update introduces a new option called CURLOPT\\_REDIR\\_PROTOCOLS which by\ndefault does not include the scp and file protocol handlers.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.15.5-1etch2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.18.2-8lenny2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.18.2-8.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\n",
