	"details": "\nIt was discovered that xapian-omega, a CGI interface for searching xapian\ndatabases, is not properly escaping user supplied input when printing\nexceptions. An attacker can use this to conduct cross-site scripting\nattacks via crafted search queries resulting in an exception and steal\npotentially sensitive data from web applications running on the same domain\nor embedding the search engine into a website.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.9-1+etch1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.7-3+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xapian-omega packages.\n\n\n",
