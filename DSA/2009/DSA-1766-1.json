	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the MIT reference implementation\nof Kerberos V5, a system for authenticating users and services on a network.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identified the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-0844](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0844)\nThe Apple Product Security team discovered that the SPNEGO GSS-API mechanism\nsuffers of a missing bounds check when reading a network input buffer which\nresults in an invalid read crashing the application or possibly leaking\ninformation.\n* [CVE-2009-0845](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0845)\nUnder certain conditions the SPNEGO GSS-API mechanism references a null pointer\nwhich crashes the application using the library.\n* [CVE-2009-0847](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0847)\nAn incorrect length check inside the ASN.1 decoder of the MIT krb5\nimplementation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash of the kinit\nor KDC program.\n* [CVE-2009-0846](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0846)\nUnder certain conditions the the ASN.1 decoder of the MIT krb5 implementation\nfrees an uninitialized pointer which could lead to denial of service and\npossibly arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.4-7etch7.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-13.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.\n\n\n",
