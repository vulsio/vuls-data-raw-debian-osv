	"summary": "changetrack - arbitrary code execution",
	"details": "\nMarek Grzybowski discovered that changetrack, a program to monitor\nchanges to (configuration) files, is prone to shell command injection\nvia metacharacters in filenames. The behaviour of the program has been\nadjusted to reject all filenames with metacharacters.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.3-3+etch1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.3-3+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.5-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your changetrack packages.\n\n\n",
