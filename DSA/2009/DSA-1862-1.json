	"details": "\nA vulnerability has been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead\nto privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problem:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-2692](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2692)\nTavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes discovered an issue with how the\n sendpage function is initialized in the proto\\_ops structure.\n Local users can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated\n privileges.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem will be fixed in\nupdates to linux-2.6 and linux-2.6.24.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.26-17lenny2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux\npackages.\n\n\nNote: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every\nlinux kernel package in all releases under active security support.\nHowever, given the high frequency at which low-severity security\nissues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of\ndoing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not\nbe released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be\nreleased in a staggered or \"leap-frog\" fashion.\n\n\n",
