(More common retrieval methods,\n such as selectall\\_arrayref and fetchrow\\_array, are not affected.)\n* [CVE-2009-1341](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1341)\nA memory leak in the routine which unquotes BYTEA values returned from\n the database allows attackers to cause a denial of service.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.49-2+etch1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable distribution (sid),\nthese problems have been fixed in version 2.1.3-1 before the release of\nlenny.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-pg-perl package.\n\n\n",
