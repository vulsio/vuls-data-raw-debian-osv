The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identified the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-1788](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1788)\nTobias Klein discovered that the VOC parsing routines suffer of a heap-based\nbuffer overflow which can be triggered by an attacker via a crafted VOC\nheader.\n* [CVE-2009-1791](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1791)\nThe vendor discovered that the AIFF parsing routines suffer of a heap-based\nbuffer overflow similar to [CVE-2009-1788](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1788) which can be triggered by an attacker\nvia a crafted AIFF header.\n\n\nIn both cases the overflowing data is not completely attacker controlled but\nstill leads to application crashes or under some circumstances might still\nlead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.16-2+etch2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.17-4+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.20-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libsndfile packages.\n\n\n",
