	],
	"summary": "roundup - privilege escalation",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that roundup, an issue tracker with a command-line,\nweb and email interface, allows users to edit resources in\nunauthorized ways, including granting themselves admin rights.\n\n\nThis update introduces stricter access checks, actually enforcing the\nconfigured permissions and roles. This means that the configuration\nmay need updating. In addition, user registration via the web\ninterface has been disabled; use the program \"roundup-admin\" from the\ncommand line instead.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.1-10+etch1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.4-4+lenny1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your roundup package.\n\n\n",
