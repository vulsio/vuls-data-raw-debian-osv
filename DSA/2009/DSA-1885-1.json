	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a\nruntime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web\nbrowser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-3070](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3070)\nJesse Ruderman discovered crashes in the layout engine, which\n might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2009-3071](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3071)\nDaniel Holbert, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay and \"toshi\" discovered\n crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2009-3072](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3072)\nJosh Soref, Jesse Ruderman and Martin Wargers discovered crashes\n in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary\n code.\n* [CVE-2009-3074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3074)\nJesse Ruderman discovered a crash in the Javascript engine, which\n might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2009-3075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3075)\nCarsten Book and \"Taral\" discovered crashes in the layout engine,\n which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2009-3076](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3076)\nJesse Ruderman discovered that the user interface for installing/\n removing PCKS #11 securiy modules wasn't informative enough, which\n might allow social engineering attacks.\n* [CVE-2009-3077](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3077)\nIt was discovered that incorrect pointer handling in the XUL parser\n could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2009-3078](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3078)\nJuan Pablo Lopez Yacubian discovered that incorrent rendering of\n some Unicode font characters could lead to spoofing attacks on\n the location bar.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.9.0.14-0lenny1.\n\n\nAs indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the\nMozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped\nbefore the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.\nYou are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still\nsupported browser.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.0.14-1.\n\n\nFor the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.1.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner package.\n\n\n",
