	"summary": "webkit - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in WebKit, a Web content engine\nlibrary for Gtk+. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-0945](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0945)\nArray index error in the insertItemBefore method in WebKit, allows remote\nattackers to execute arbitrary code via a document with a SVGPathList data\nstructure containing a negative index in the SVGTransformList, SVGStringList,\nSVGNumberList, SVGPathSegList, SVGPointList, or SVGLengthList SVGList object,\nwhich triggers memory corruption.\n* [CVE-2009-1687](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1687)\nThe JavaScript garbage collector in WebKit does not properly handle allocation\nfailures, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a\ndenial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML\ndocument that triggers write access to an \"offset of a NULL pointer.\"\n* [CVE-2009-1690](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1690)\nUse-after-free vulnerability in WebKit, allows remote attackers to execute\narbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application\ncrash) by setting an unspecified property of an HTML tag that causes child\nelements to be freed and later accessed when an HTML error occurs, related to\n\"recursion in certain DOM event handlers.\"\n* [CVE-2009-1698](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1698)\nWebKit does not initialize a pointer during handling of a Cascading Style Sheets\n(CSS) attr function call with a large numerical argument, which allows remote\nattackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory\ncorruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML document.\n* [CVE-2009-1711](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1711)\nWebKit does not properly initialize memory for Attr DOM objects, which allows\nremote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service\n(application crash) via a crafted HTML document.\n* [CVE-2009-1712](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1712)\nWebKit does not prevent remote loading of local Java applets, which allows\nremote attackers to execute arbitrary code, gain privileges, or obtain sensitive\ninformation via an APPLET or OBJECT element.\n* [CVE-2009-1725](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1725)\nWebKit do not properly handle numeric character references, which allows remote\nattackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory\ncorruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML document.\n* [CVE-2009-1714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1714)\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Web Inspector in WebKit allows\nuser-assisted remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML, and read\nlocal files, via vectors related to the improper escaping of HTML attributes.\n* [CVE-2009-1710](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1710)\nWebKit allows remote attackers to spoof the browser's display of the host name,\nsecurity indicators, and unspecified other UI elements via a custom cursor in\nconjunction with a modified CSS3 hotspot property.\n* [CVE-2009-1697](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1697)\nCRLF injection vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to inject HTTP\nheaders and bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted HTML document, related\nto cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that depend on communication with\narbitrary web sites on the same server through use of XMLHttpRequest without a\nHost header.\n* [CVE-2009-1695](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1695)\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to\ninject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving access to frame\ncontents after completion of a page transition.\n* [CVE-2009-1693](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1693)\nWebKit allows remote attackers to read images from arbitrary web sites via a\nCANVAS element with an SVG image, related to a \"cross-site image capture issue.\"\n* [CVE-2009-1694](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1694)\nWebKit does not properly handle redirects, which allows remote attackers to read\nimages from arbitrary web sites via vectors involving a CANVAS element and\nredirection, related to a \"cross-site image capture issue.\"\n* [CVE-2009-1681](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1681)\nWebKit does not prevent web sites from loading third-party content into a\nsubframe, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and\nconduct \"clickjacking\" attacks via a crafted HTML document.\n* [CVE-2009-1684](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1684)\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to\ninject arbitrary web script or HTML via an event handler that triggers script\nexecution in the context of the next loaded document.\n* [CVE-2009-1692](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1692)\nWebKit allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption\nor device reset) via a web page containing an HTMLSelectElement object with a\nlarge length attribute, related to the length property of a Select object.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.1-4+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.1.16-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your webkit package.\n\n\n",
