	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in cacti, a frontend to rrdtool\nfor monitoring systems and services. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-3112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3112), [CVE-2007-3113](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3113)\nIt was discovered that cacti is prone to a denial of service via the\ngraph\\_height, graph\\_width, graph\\_start and graph\\_end parameters.\nThis issue only affects the oldstable (etch) version of cacti.\n* [CVE-2009-4032](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4032)\nIt was discovered that cacti is prone to several cross-site scripting\nattacks via different vectors.\n* [CVE-2009-4112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4112)\nIt has been discovered that cacti allows authenticated administrator\nusers to gain access to the host system by executing arbitrary commands\nvia the \"Data Input Method\" for the \"Linux - Get Memory Usage\" setting.\n\n\nThere is no fix for this issue at this stage. Upstream will implement a\nwhitelist policy to only allow certain \"safe\" commands. For the moment,\nwe recommend that such access is only given to trusted users and that\nthe options \"Data Input\" and \"User Administration\" are otherwise\ndeactivated.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.8.6i-3.6.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.7b-2.1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.7e-1.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.\n\n\n",
