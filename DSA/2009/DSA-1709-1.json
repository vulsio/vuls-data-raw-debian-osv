	"details": "\nPaul Szabo discovered that login, the system login tool, did not\ncorrectly handle symlinks while setting up tty permissions. If a local\nattacker were able to gain control of the system utmp file, they could\ncause login to change the ownership and permissions on arbitrary files,\nleading to a root privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.18.1-7+etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.1.1-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your shadow package.\n\n\n",
