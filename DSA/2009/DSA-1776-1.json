These groups may be system groups with elevated\nprivileges, which may allow a valid SLURM user to gain elevated privileges.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (etch) does not contain a slurm-llnl package.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.6-1lenny3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.15-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your slurm-llnl package.\n\n\n",
