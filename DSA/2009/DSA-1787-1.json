	"summary": "linux-2.6.24 - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-4307](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4307)\nBryn M. Reeves reported a denial of service in the NFS filesystem.\n Local users can trigger a kernel BUG() due to a race condition in\n the do\\_setlk function.\n* [CVE-2008-5079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5079)\nHugo Dias reported a DoS condition in the ATM subsystem that can\n be triggered by a local user by calling the svc\\_listen function\n twice on the same socket and reading /proc/net/atm/\\*vc.\n* [CVE-2008-5395](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5395)\nHelge Deller discovered a denial of service condition that allows\n local users on PA-RISC systems to crash a system by attempting to\n unwind a stack containing userspace addresses.\n* [CVE-2008-5700](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5700)\nAlan Cox discovered a lack of minimum timeouts on SG\\_IO requests,\n which allows local users of systems using ATA to cause a denial of\n service by forcing drives into PIO mode.\n* [CVE-2008-5701](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5701)\nVlad Malov reported an issue on 64-bit MIPS systems where a local\n user could cause a system crash by crafing a malicious binary\n which makes o32 syscalls with a number less than 4000.\n* [CVE-2008-5702](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5702)\nZvonimir Rakamaric reported an off-by-one error in the ib700wdt\n watchdog driver which allows local users to cause a buffer\n underflow by making a specially crafted WDIOC\\_SETTIMEOUT ioctl\n call.\n* [CVE-2009-0028](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0028)\nChris Evans discovered a situation in which a child process can\n send an arbitrary signal to its parent.\n* [CVE-2009-0029](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0029)\nChristian Borntraeger discovered an issue effecting the alpha,\n mips, powerpc, s390 and sparc64 architectures that allows local\n users to cause a denial of service or potentially gain elevated\n privileges.\n* [CVE-2009-0031](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0031)\nVegard Nossum discovered a memory leak in the keyctl subsystem\n that allows local users to cause a denial of service by consuming\n all of kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2009-0065](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0065)\nWei Yongjun discovered a memory overflow in the SCTP\n implementation that can be triggered by remote users, permitting\n remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2009-0269](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0269)\nDuane Griffin provided a fix for an issue in the eCryptfs\n subsystem which allows local users to cause a denial of service\n (fault or memory corruption).\n* [CVE-2009-0322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0322)\nPavel Roskin provided a fix for an issue in the dell\\_rbu driver\n that allows a local user to cause a denial of service (oops) by\n reading 0 bytes from a sysfs entry.\n* [CVE-2009-0675](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0675)\nRoel Kluin discovered inverted logic in the skfddi driver that\n permits local, unprivileged users to reset the driver statistics.\n* [CVE-2009-0676](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0676)\nClement LECIGNE discovered a bug in the sock\\_getsockopt function\n that may result in leaking sensitive kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2009-0745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0745)\nPeter Kerwien discovered an issue in the ext4 filesystem that\n allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel oops)\n during a resize operation.\n* [CVE-2009-0834](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0834)\nRoland McGrath discovered an issue on amd64 kernels that allows\n local users to circumvent system call audit configurations which\n filter based on the syscall numbers or argument details.\n* [CVE-2009-0859](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0859)\nJiri Olsa discovered that a local user can cause a denial of\n service (system hang) using a SHM\\_INFO shmctl call on kernels\n compiled with CONFIG\\_SHMEM disabled. This issue does not affect\n prebuilt Debian kernels.\n* [CVE-2009-1046](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1046)\nMikulas Patocka reported an issue in the console subsystem that\n allows a local user to cause memory corruption by selecting a\n small number of 3-byte UTF-8 characters.\n* [CVE-2009-1192](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1192)\nShaohua Li reported an issue in the AGP subsystem that may allow\n local users to read sensitive kernel memory due to a leak of\n uninitialized memory.\n* [CVE-2009-1242](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1242)\nBenjamin Gilbert reported a local denial of service vulnerability\n in the KVM VMX implementation that allows local users to trigger\n an oops.\n* [CVE-2009-1265](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1265)\nThomas Pollet reported an overflow in the af\\_rose implementation\n that allows remote attackers to retrieve uninitialized kernel\n memory that may contain sensitive data.\n* [CVE-2009-1337](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1337)\nOleg Nesterov discovered an issue in the exit\\_notify function that\n allows local users to send an arbitrary signal to a process by\n running a program that modifies the exit\\_signal field and then\n uses an exec system call to launch a setuid application.\n* [CVE-2009-1338](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1338)\nDaniel Hokka Zakrisson discovered that a kill(-1) is permitted to\n reach processes outside of the current process namespace.\n* [CVE-2009-1439](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1439)\nPavan Naregundi reported an issue in the CIFS filesystem code that\n allows remote users to overwrite memory via a long\n nativeFileSystem field in a Tree Connect response during mount.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.8etch1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.\n\n\nNote: Debian 'etch' includes linux kernel packages based upon both the\n2.6.18 and 2.6.24 linux releases. All known security issues are\ncarefully tracked against both packages and both packages will receive\nsecurity updates until security support for Debian 'etch'\nconcludes. However, given the high frequency at which low-severity\nsecurity issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource\nrequirements of doing an update, lower severity 2.6.18 and 2.6.24\nupdates will typically release in a staggered or \"leap-frog\" fashion.\n\n\n",
