	"details": "\nSeveral security issues have been discovered in kde4libs, core libraries\nfor all KDE 4 applications. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-1690](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1690)\nIt was discovered that there is a use-after-free flaw in handling\ncertain DOM event handlers. This could lead to the execution of\narbitrary code, when visiting a malicious website.\n* [CVE-2009-1698](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1698)\nIt was discovered that there could be an uninitialised pointer when\nhandling a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attr function call. This could\nlead to the execution of arbitrary code, when visiting a malicious\nwebsite.\n* [CVE-2009-1687](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1687)\nIt was discovered that the JavaScript garbage collector does not handle\nallocation failures properly, which could lead to the execution of\narbitrary code when visiting a malicious website.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain kde4libs.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4:4.1.0-3+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed\nsoon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4:4.3.0-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kde4libs packages.\n\n\n",
