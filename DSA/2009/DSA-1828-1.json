	"summary": "ocsinventory-agent - arbitrary code execution",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that the ocsinventory-agent which is part of the\nocsinventory suite, a hardware and software configuration indexing service,\nis prone to an insecure perl module search path. As the agent is started\nvia cron and the current directory (/ in this case) is included in the\ndefault perl module path the agent scans every directory on the system\nfor its perl modules. This enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code\nvia a crafted ocsinventory-agent perl module placed on the system.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain ocsinventory-agent.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:0.0.9.2repack1-4lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:0.0.9.2repack1-5\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:0.0.9.2repack1-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ocsinventory-agent packages.\n\n\n",
