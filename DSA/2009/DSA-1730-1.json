	"details": "\nThe security update for proftpd-dfsg in DSA-1727-1 caused a regression\nwith the postgresql backend. This update corrects the flaw. Also it was\ndiscovered that the oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by the\nsecurity issues. For reference the original advisory follows.\n\n\nTwo SQL injection vulnerabilities have been found in proftpd, a\nvirtual-hosting FTP daemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-0542](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0542)\nShino discovered that proftpd is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability\n via the use of certain characters in the username.\n* [CVE-2009-0543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0543)\nTJ Saunders discovered that proftpd is prone to an SQL injection\n vulnerability due to insufficient escaping mechanisms, when multybite\n character encodings are used.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.1-17lenny2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed\nsoon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.2-1.\n\n\n",
