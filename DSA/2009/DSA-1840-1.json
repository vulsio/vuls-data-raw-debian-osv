	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a\nruntime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web\nbrowser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-2462](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2462)\nMartijn Wargers, Arno Renevier, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay and Blake\nKaplan discovered several issues in the browser engine that could\npotentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code. (MFSA 2009-34)\n* [CVE-2009-2463](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2463)\nmonarch2020 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function.\n(MFSA 2009-34)\n* [CVE-2009-2464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2464)\nChristophe Charron reported a possibly exploitable crash occurring when\nmultiple RDF files were loaded in a XUL tree element. (MFSA 2009-34)\n* [CVE-2009-2465](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2465)\nYongqian Li reported that an unsafe memory condition could be created by\nspecially crafted document.
