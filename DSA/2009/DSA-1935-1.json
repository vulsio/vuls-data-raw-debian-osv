([CVE-2009-2730](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2730))\n\n\nIn addition, with this update, certificates with MD2 hash signatures are no\nlonger accepted since they're no longer considered cryptograhically secure. It\nonly affects the oldstable distribution (etch).([CVE-2009-2409](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2409))\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version\n1.4.4-3+etch5 for gnutls13.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version\n2.4.2-6+lenny2 for gnutls26.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),\nthese problems have been fixed in version 2.8.3-1 for gnutls26.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnutls13/gnutls26 packages.\n\n\n",
