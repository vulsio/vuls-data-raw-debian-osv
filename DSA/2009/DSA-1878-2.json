	"summary": "devscripts - regression fix",
	"details": "\nRaphael Geissert discovered that uscan, a program to check for\navailability of new source code versions which is part of the\ndevscripts package, runs Perl code downloaded from potentially\nuntrusted sources to implement its URL and version mangling\nfunctionality. This update addresses this issue by reimplementing the\nrelevant Perl operators without relying on the Perl interpreter,\ntrying to preserve backwards compatibility as much as possible.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.9.26etch4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.10.35lenny6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed in\nversion 2.10.54.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your devscripts package.\n\n\n",
