	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Quagga, an IP routing daemon, could no longer\nprocess the Internet routing table due to broken handling of multiple\n4-byte AS numbers in an AS path. If such a prefix is received, the\nBGP daemon crashes with an assert failure, leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.99.10-1lenny2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.99.11-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your quagga package.\n\n\n",
