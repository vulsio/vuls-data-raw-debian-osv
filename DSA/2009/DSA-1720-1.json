	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the TYPO3 web\ncontent management framework.\n\n\nMarcus Krause and Michael Stucki from the TYPO3 security team\ndiscovered that the jumpUrl mechanism discloses secret hashes enabling\na remote attacker to bypass access control by submitting the correct\nvalue as a URL parameter and thus being able to read the content of\narbitrary files.\n\n\nJelmer de Hen and Dmitry Dulepov discovered multiple cross-site\nscripting vulnerabilities in the backend user interface allowing\nremote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n\n\nAs it is very likely that your encryption key has been exposed we\nstrongly recommend to change your encryption key via the install tool\nafter installing the update.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.0.2+debian-8.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.2.5-1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.2.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your typo3 package.\n\n\n",
