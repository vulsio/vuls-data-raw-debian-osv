	"summary": "cups cupsys - denial of service",
	"details": "\nAnibal Sacco discovered that cups, a general printing system for UNIX\nsystems, suffers from null pointer dereference because of its handling\nof two consecutive IPP packets with certain tag attributes that are\ntreated as IPP\\_TAG\\_UNSUPPORTED tags. This allows unauthenticated attackers\nto perform denial of service attacks by crashing the cups daemon.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.7-4+etch8 of cupsys.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.8-1+lenny6 of cups.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cups/cupsys packages.\n\n\n",
