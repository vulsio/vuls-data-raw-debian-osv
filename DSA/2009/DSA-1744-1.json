This can be used by an attacker to crash user clients\nvia a crafted PRIVMSG command.\n\n\nThe weechat version in the oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected\nby this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.2.6-1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.2.6.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your weechat packages.\n\n\n",
