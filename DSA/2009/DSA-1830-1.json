	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Icedove\nmail client, an unbranded version of the Thunderbird mail client. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-0040](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0040)\nThe execution of arbitrary code might be possible via a crafted PNG file\nthat triggers a free of an uninitialized pointer in (1) the png\\_read\\_png\nfunction, (2) pCAL chunk handling, or (3) setup of 16-bit gamma tables. \n(MFSA 2009-10)\n* [CVE-2009-0352](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0352)\nIt is possible to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the\nlayout engine. (MFSA 2009-01)\n* [CVE-2009-0353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0353)\nIt is possible to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the\nJavaScript engine. (MFSA 2009-01)\n* [CVE-2009-0652](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0652)\nBjoern Hoehrmann and Moxie Marlinspike discovered a possible spoofing\nattack via Unicode box drawing characters in internationalized domain\nnames. (MFSA 2009-15)\n* [CVE-2009-0771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0771)\nMemory corruption and assertion failures have been discovered in the\nlayout engine, leading to the possible execution of arbitrary code. \n(MFSA 2009-07)\n* [CVE-2009-0772](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0772)\nThe layout engine allows the execution of arbitrary code in vectors\nrelated to nsCSSStyleSheet::GetOwnerNode, events, and garbage\ncollection. (MFSA 2009-07)\n* [CVE-2009-0773](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0773)\nThe JavaScript engine is prone to the execution of arbitrary code via\nseveral vectors. (MFSA 2009-07)\n* [CVE-2009-0774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0774)\nThe layout engine allows the execution of arbitrary code via vectors\nrelated to gczeal. (MFSA 2009-07)\n* [CVE-2009-0776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0776)\nGeorgi Guninski discovered that it is possible to obtain xml data via\nan issue related to the nsIRDFService. (MFSA 2009-09)\n* [CVE-2009-1302](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1302)\nThe browser engine is prone to a possible memory corruption via several\nvectors. (MFSA 2009-14)\n* [CVE-2009-1303](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1303)\nThe browser engine is prone to a possible memory corruption via the\nnsSVGElement::BindToTree function. (MFSA 2009-14)\n* [CVE-2009-1307](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1307)\nGregory Fleischer discovered that it is possible to bypass the Same\nOrigin Policy when opening a Flash file via the view-source: scheme.\n(MFSA 2009-17)\n* [CVE-2009-1832](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1832)\nThe possible arbitrary execution of code was discovered via vectors\ninvolving \"double frame construction.\" (MFSA 2009-24)\n* [CVE-2009-1392](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1392)\nSeveral issues were discovered in the browser engine as used by icedove,\nwhich could lead to the possible execution of arbitrary code.\n(MFSA 2009-24)\n* [CVE-2009-1836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1836)\nShuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang and Ming Zhang reported a potential\nman-in-the-middle attack, when using a proxy due to insufficient checks\non a certain proxy response. (MFSA 2009-27)\n* [CVE-2009-1838](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1838)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary\nJavaScript with chrome privileges due to an error in the\ngarbage collection implementation. (MFSA 2009-29)\n* [CVE-2009-1841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1841)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 reported that it is possible for scripts from page content\nto run with elevated privileges and thus potentially executing arbitrary\ncode with the object's chrome privileges. (MFSA 2009-32)\n* No CVE id yet\n\nBernd Jendrissek discovered a potentially exploitable crash when viewing\na multipart/alternative mail message with a text/enhanced part.\n(MFSA 2009-33)\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.0.22-0lenny1.\n\n\nAs indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the\nMozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped\nbefore the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.\nYou are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still\nsupported mail client.\n\n\nFor the testing (squeeze) distribution these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.0.22-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.\n\n\n",
