	"summary": "ldns - arbitrary code execution",
	"details": "\nStefan Kaltenbrunner discovered that ldns, a library and set of utilities\nto facilitate DNS programming, did not correctly implement a buffer\nboundary check in its RR DNS record parser. This weakness could enable\noverflow of a heap buffer if a maliciously-crafted record is parsed,\npotentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code. The scope of\ncompromise will vary with the context in which ldns is used, and could\npresent either a local or remote attack vector.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.0-1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem was fixed in\nversion 1.5.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ldns packages.\n\n\n",
