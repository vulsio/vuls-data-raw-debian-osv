This vulnerability only affects the lenny\nversions of dhcp3-server and dhcp3-server-ldap.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.0.4-13+etch2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.1.1-6+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed\nsoon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dhcp3 packages.\n\n\n",
