The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-2285](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2285)\nIt was discovered that malformed TIFF images can lead to a crash\n in the decompression code, resulting in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2009-2347](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2347)\nAndrea Barisani discovered several integer overflows, which\n can lead to the execution of arbitrary code if malformed\n images are passed to the rgb2ycbcr or tiff2rgba tools.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.8.2-7+etch3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.8.2-11.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.\n\n\n",
