	"details": "\nSeveral local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the PAM module\nfor MIT Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-0360](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0360)\nRuss Allbery discovered that the Kerberos PAM module parsed\n configuration settings from environment variables when run from a\n setuid context. This could lead to local privilege escalation if\n an attacker points a setuid program using PAM authentication to a\n Kerberos setup under her control.\n* [CVE-2009-0361](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0361)\nDerek Chan discovered that the Kerberos PAM module allows\n reinitialisation of user credentials when run from a setuid\n context, resulting in potential local denial of service by\n overwriting the credential cache file or to privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6-1etch1.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been\nfixed in version 3.11-4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpam-krb5 package.\n\n\n",
