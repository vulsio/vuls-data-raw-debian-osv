	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool\nto administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-1150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1150)\nCross site scripting vulnerability in the export page allow for an\n attacker that can place crafted cookies with the user to inject\n arbitrary web script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2009-1151](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1151)\nStatic code injection allows for a remote attacker to inject arbitrary\n code into phpMyAdmin via the setup.php script. This script is in Debian\n under normal circumstances protected via Apache authentication.\n However, because of a recent worm based on this exploit, we are patching\n it regardless, to also protect installations that somehow still expose\n the setup.php script.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.9.1.1-11.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.11.8.1-5+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.1.3.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.\n\n\n",
