	"details": "\n* [CVE-2009-1890](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1890)\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod\\_proxy module when\nit was used as a reverse proxy. A remote attacker could use this flaw\nto force a proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. This\nissue did not affect Debian 4.0 \"etch\".\n* [CVE-2009-1891](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1891)\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod\\_deflate module.\nThis module continued to compress large files until compression was\ncomplete, even if the network connection that requested the content\nwas closed before compression completed. This would cause mod\\_deflate\nto consume large amounts of CPU if mod\\_deflate was enabled for a large\nfile. A similar flaw related to HEAD requests for compressed content\nwas also fixed.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.3-4+etch9.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.9-10+lenny4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems will be fixed in version 2.2.11-7.\n\n\nThis advisory also provides updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which\nhave been recompiled against the new apache2 packages.\n\n\nUpdated packages for the s390 and mipsel architectures are not\nincluded yet. They will be released as soon as they become available.\n\n\n",
