	"summary": "ntp - denial of service",
	"details": "\nRobin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov discovered that the daemon component of\nthe ntp package, a reference implementation of the NTP protocol, is\nnot properly reacting to certain incoming packets.\n\n\nAn unexpected NTP mode 7 packet (MODE\\_PRIVATE) with spoofed IP data can lead\nntpd to reply with a mode 7 response to the spoofed address. This may result\nin the service playing packet ping-pong with other ntp servers or even itself\nwhich causes CPU usage and excessive disk use due to logging. An attacker\ncan use this to conduct denial of service attacks.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:4.2.2.p4+dfsg-2etch4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:4.2.4p4+dfsg-8lenny3.\n\n\nFor the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.\n\n\n",
