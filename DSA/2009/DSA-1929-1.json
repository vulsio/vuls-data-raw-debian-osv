	"summary": "linux-2.6 - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a denial of service, sensitive memory leak or privilege\nescalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-1883](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1883)\nSolar Designer discovered a missing capability check in the\n z90crypt driver or s390 systems. This vulnerability may allow\n a local user to gain elevated privileges.\n* [CVE-2009-2909](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2909)\nArjan van de Ven discovered an issue in the AX.25 protocol\n implementation. A specially crafted call to setsockopt() can\n result in a denial of service (kernel oops).\n* [CVE-2009-3001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3001)\nJiri Slaby fixed a sensitive memory leak issue in the ANSI/IEEE\n 802.2 LLC implementation. This is not exploitable in the Debian\n lenny kernel as root privileges are required to exploit this\n issue.\n* [CVE-2009-3002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3002)\nEric Dumazet fixed several sensitive memory leaks in the IrDA,\n X.25 PLP (Rose), NET/ROM, Acorn Econet/AUN, and Controller Area\n Network (CAN) implementations. Local users can exploit these\n issues to gain access to kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2009-3228](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3228)\nEric Dumazet reported an instance of uninitialized kernel memory\n in the network packet scheduler. Local users may be able to\n exploit this issue to read the contents of sensitive kernel\n memory.\n* [CVE-2009-3238](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3238)\nLinus Torvalds provided a change to the get\\_random\\_int() function\n to increase its randomness.\n* [CVE-2009-3286](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3286)\nEric Paris discovered an issue with the NFSv4 server\n implementation. When an O\\_EXCL create fails, files may be left\n with corrupted permissions, possibly granting unintentional\n privileges to other local users.\n* [CVE-2009-3547](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3547)\nEarl Chew discovered a NULL pointer dereference issue in the\n pipe\\_rdwr\\_open function which can be used by local users to gain\n elevated privileges.\n* [CVE-2009-3612](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3612)\nJiri Pirko discovered a typo in the initialization of a structure\n in the netlink subsystem that may allow local users to gain access\n to sensitive kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2009-3621](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3621)\nTomoki Sekiyama discovered a deadlock condition in the UNIX domain\n socket implementation. Local users can exploit this vulnerability\n to cause a denial of service (system hang).\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.18.dfsg.1-26etch1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and\nuser-mode-linux packages.\n\n\nNote: Debian 'etch' includes linux kernel packages based upon both the\n2.6.18 and 2.6.24 linux releases. All known security issues are\ncarefully tracked against both packages and both packages will receive\nsecurity updates until security support for Debian 'etch'\nconcludes. However, given the high frequency at which low-severity\nsecurity issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource\nrequirements of doing an update, lower severity 2.6.18 and 2.6.24\nupdates will typically release in a staggered or \"leap-frog\" fashion.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 4.0 (etch) |\n| --- | --- |\n| fai-kernels | 1.17+etch.26etch1 |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.18-1um-2etch.26etch1 |\n\n\n",
