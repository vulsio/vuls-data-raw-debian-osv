The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-0581](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0581)\nChris Evans discovered that lcms is affected by a memory leak, which\ncould result in a denial of service via specially crafted image files.\n* [CVE-2009-0723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0723)\nChris Evans discovered that lcms is prone to several integer overflows\nvia specially crafted image files, which could lead to the execution of\narbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2009-0733](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0733)\nChris Evans discovered the lack of upper-bounds check on sizes leading\nto a buffer overflow, which could be used to execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.17.dfsg-1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.15-1.1+etch2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lcms packages.\n\n\n",
