	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in libgd2, a library for\nprogrammatic graphics creation and manipulation. The Common \nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-0455](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0455)\nKees Cook discovered a buffer overflow in libgd2's font renderer. An\n attacker could cause denial of service (application crash) and \n possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted string with a JIS\n encoded font. This issue only affects the oldstable distribution\n (etch).\n* [CVE-2009-3546](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3546)\nTomas Hoger discovered a boundary error in the \"\\_gdGetColors()\" \n function. An attacker could conduct a buffer overflow or buffer \n over-read attacks via a crafted GD file.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.33-5.2etch2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-3+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable\ndistribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version\n2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-3.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.\n\n\n",
