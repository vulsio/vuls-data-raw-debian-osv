	"details": "\nSeveral security issues have been discovered in wesnoth, a fantasy\nturn-based strategy game. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-0366](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0366)\nDaniel Franke discovered that the wesnoth server is prone to a denial of\nservice attack when receiving special crafted compressed data.\n* [CVE-2009-0367](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0367)\nDaniel Franke discovered that the sandbox implementation for the python\nAIs can be used to execute arbitrary python code on wesnoth clients. In\norder to prevent this issue, the python support has been disabled. A\ncompatibility patch was included, so that the affected campagne is still\nworking properly.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.4-2+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.2-5.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.7-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wesnoth packages.\n\n\n",
