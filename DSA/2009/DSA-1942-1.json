	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark\nnetwork traffic analyzer, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary\ncode or denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-2560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2560)\nA NULL pointer dereference was found in the RADIUS dissector.\n* [CVE-2009-3550](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3550)\nA NULL pointer dereference was found in the DCERP/NT dissector.\n* [CVE-2009-3829](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3829)\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the ERF parser.\n\n\nThis update also includes fixes for three minor issues\n([CVE-2008-1829](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1829),\n[CVE-2009-2562](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2562),\n[CVE-2009-3241](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3241)),\nwhich were scheduled for the next stable point update. Also\n[CVE-2009-1268](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1268)\nwas fixed for Etch. Since this security update was issued prior to the release\nof the point update, the fixes were included.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.99.4-5.etch.4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in \nversion 1.0.2-3+lenny7.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Wireshark packages.\n\n\n",
