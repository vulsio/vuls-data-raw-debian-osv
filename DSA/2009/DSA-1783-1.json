	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been identified affecting MySQL, a\nrelational database server, and its associated interactive client\napplication. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following two problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-3963](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3963)\nKay Roepke reported that the MySQL server would not properly handle\n an empty bit-string literal in an SQL statement, allowing an\n authenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (a crash)\n in mysqld. This issue affects the oldstable distribution (etch), but\n not the stable distribution (lenny).\n* [CVE-2008-4456](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4456)\nThomas Henlich reported that the MySQL commandline client application\n did not encode HTML special characters when run in HTML output mode\n (that is, \"mysql --html ...\"). This could potentially lead to\n cross-site scripting or unintended script privilege escalation if\n the resulting output is viewed in a browser or incorporated into\n a web site.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.0.32-7etch10.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.0.51a-24+lenny1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.\n\n\n",
