	"summary": "pygresql - missing escape function",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that pygresql, a PostgreSQL module for Python, was\nmissing a function to call PQescapeStringConn(). This is needed, because\nPQescapeStringConn() honours the charset of the connection and prevents\ninsufficient escaping, when certain multibyte character encodings are\nused. The new function is called pg\\_escape\\_string(), which takes the\ndatabase connection as a first argument. The old function\nescape\\_string() has been preserved as well for backwards compatibility.\n\n\nDevelopers using these bindings are encouraged to adjust their code to\nuse the new function.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:3.8.1-1etch2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:3.8.1-3+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:4.0-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pygresql packages.\n\n\n",
