	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in kvm, a full virtualization system.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-3638](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3638)\nIt was discovered an Integer overflow in the kvm\\_dev\\_ioctl\\_get\\_supported\\_cpuid\nfunction. This allows local users to have an unspecified impact via a\nKVM\\_GET\\_SUPPORTED\\_CPUID request to the kvm\\_arch\\_dev\\_ioctl function.\n* [CVE-2009-3722](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3722)\nIt was discovered that the handle\\_dr function in the KVM subsystem does not\nproperly verify the Current Privilege Level (CPL) before accessing a debug\nregister, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (trap) on the\nhost OS via a crafted application.\n* [CVE-2009-4031](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4031)\nIt was discovered that the do\\_insn\\_fetch function in the x86 emulator in the KVM\nsubsystem tries to interpret instructions that contain too many bytes to be\nvalid, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (increased\nscheduling latency) on the host OS via unspecified manipulations related to SMP\nsupport.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version\n72+dfsg-5~lenny4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),\nthese problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kvm package.\n\n\n",
