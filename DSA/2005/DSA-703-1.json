This can lead to the\n execution of arbitrary code when connected to a malicious server.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.4-5woody8.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 package.\n\n\n",
