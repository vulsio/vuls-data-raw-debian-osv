The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-2945](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2945)\nEric Romang discovered that the ARC archive program under Unix\n creates a temporary file with insecure permissions which may lead\n to an attacker stealing sensitive information.\n* [CAN-2005-2992](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2992)\nJoey Schulze discovered that the temporary file was created in an\n insecure fashion as well, leaving it open to a classic symlink\n attack.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain arc packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.21l-1sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.21m-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your arc package.\n\n\n",
