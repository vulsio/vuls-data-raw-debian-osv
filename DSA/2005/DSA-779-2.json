	"details": "\nWe experienced that the update for Mozilla Firefox from DSA 779-1\nunfortunately was a regression in several cases. Â Since the usual\npraxis of backporting apparently does not work, this update is\nbasically version 1.0.6 with the version number rolled back, and hence\nstill named 1.0.4-\\*. Â For completeness below is the original advisory\ntext:\n\n\n\n> \n> Several problems have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox, a\n> lightweight web browser based on Mozilla. The Common Vulnerabilities\n> and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n> \n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2260](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2260)\n> The browser user interface does not properly distinguish between\n>  user-generated events and untrusted synthetic events, which makes\n>  it easier for remote attackers to perform dangerous actions that\n>  normally could only be performed manually by the user.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2261](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2261)\n> XML scripts ran even when Javascript disabled.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2262](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2262)\n> The user can be tricked to executing arbitrary JavaScript code by\n>  using a JavaScript URL as wallpaper.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2263](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2263)\n> It is possible for a remote attacker to execute a callback\n>  function in the context of another domain (i.e. frame).\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2264](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2264)\n> By opening a malicious link in the sidebar it is possible for\n>  remote attackers to steal sensitive information.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2265](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2265)\n> Missing input sanitising of InstallVersion.compareTo() can cause\n>  the application to crash.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2266](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2266)\n> Remote attackers could steal sensitive information such as cookies\n>  and passwords from web sites by accessing data in alien frames.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2267](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2267)\n> By using standalone applications such as Flash and QuickTime to\n>  open a javascript: URL, it is possible for a remote attacker to\n>  steal sensitive information and possibly execute arbitrary code.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2268](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2268)\n> It is possible for a Javascript dialog box to spoof a dialog box\n>  from a trusted site and facilitates phishing attacks.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2269](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2269)\n> Remote attackers could modify certain tag properties of DOM nodes\n>  that could lead to the execution of arbitrary script or code.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-2270](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2270)\n> The Mozilla browser family does not properly clone base objects,\n>  which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.4-2sarge3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Mozilla Firefox packages.\n\n\n",
