	"summary": "zip - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nA buffer overflow has been discovered in zip, the archiver for .zip\nfiles. When doing recursive folder compression the program did not\ncheck the resulting path length, which would lead to memory being\noverwritten. A malicious person could convince a user to create an\narchive containing a specially crafted path name, which could lead to\nthe execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.30-5woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.30-8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zip package.\n\n\n",
