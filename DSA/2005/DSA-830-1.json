	"summary": "ntlmaps - wrong permissions",
	"details": "\nDrew Parsons noticed that the post-installation script of ntlmaps, an\nNTLM authorisation proxy server, changes the permissions of the\nconfiguration file to be world-readable. It contains the user name\nand password of the Windows NT system that ntlmaps connects to and,\nhence, leaks them to local users.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain an ntlmaps package.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.9-2sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.9-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ntlmaps package.\n\n\n",
