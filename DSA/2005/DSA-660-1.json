This can be exploited by an attacker\nwith physical access to the workstation to take over the desktop\nsession.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.2-14.9.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed upstream in KDE 3.0.5 and is therefore\nfixed in the unstable (sid) and testing (sarge) distributions already.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kscreensaver package.\n\n\n",
