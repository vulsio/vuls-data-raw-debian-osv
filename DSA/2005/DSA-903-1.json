	"summary": "unzip - race condition",
	"details": "\nThe unzip update in DSA 903 contained a regression so that symbolic\nlinks that are resolved later in a zip archive aren't supported\nanymore. Â This update corrects this behaviour. Â For completeness,\nbelow please find the original advisory text:\n\n\n\n> \n> Imran Ghory discovered a race condition in the permissions setting\n> code in unzip. When decompressing a file in a directory an attacker\n> has access to, unzip could be tricked to set the file permissions to a\n> different file the user has permissions to.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.50-1woody5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.52-1sarge3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.52-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unzip package.\n\n\n",
