	"details": "\nImran Ghory discovered a race condition in bzip2, a high-quality\nblock-sorting file compressor and decompressor. When decompressing a\nfile in a directory an attacker has access to, bunzip2 could be\ntricked to set the file permissions to a different file the user has\npermissions to.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-1.woody2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bzip2 packages.\n\n\n",
