The ability to create user-defined\nfunctions is not typically granted to untrusted users.\n\n\nThe following vulnerability matrix shows which version of MySQL in\nwhich distribution has this problem fixed:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | woody | sarge | sid |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| mysql | 3.23.49-8.14 | n/a | n/a |\n| mysql-dfsg | n/a | 4.0.24-10sarge1 | 4.0.24-10sarge1 |\n| mysql-dfsg-4.1 | n/a | 4.1.11a-4sarge2 | 4.1.14-2 |\n| mysql-dfsg-5.0 | n/a | n/a | 5.0.11beta-3 |\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg packages.\n\n\n",
