	"summary": "mozilla-thunderbird - several",
	"details": "\nSeveral security-related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and\nderived programs. Some of the following problems don't exactly apply\nto Mozilla Thunderbird, even though the code is present. In order to\nkeep the codebase in sync with upstream it has been altered\nnevertheless. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-2871](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2871)\nTom Ferris discovered a bug in the IDN hostname handling of\n Mozilla that allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n and possibly execute arbitrary code via a hostname with dashes.\n* [CAN-2005-2701](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2701)\nA buffer overflow allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary\n code via an XBM image file that ends in a large number of spaces\n instead of the expected end tag.\n* [CAN-2005-2702](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2702)\nMats Palmgren discovered a buffer overflow in the Unicode string\n parser that allows a specially crafted Unicode sequence to\n overflow a buffer and cause arbitrary code to be executed.\n* [CAN-2005-2703](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2703)\nRemote attackers could spoof HTTP headers of XML HTTP requests\n via XMLHttpRequest and possibly use the client to exploit\n vulnerabilities in servers or proxies.\n* [CAN-2005-2704](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2704)\nRemote attackers could spoof DOM objects via an XBL control that\n implements an internal XPCOM interface.\n* [CAN-2005-2705](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2705)\nGeorgi Guninski discovered an integer overflow in the JavaScript\n engine that might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary\n code.\n* [CAN-2005-2706](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2706)\nRemote attackers could execute Javascript code with chrome\n privileges via an about: page such as about:mozilla.\n* [CAN-2005-2707](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2707)\nRemote attackers could spawn windows without user interface\n components such as the address and status bar that could be used\n to conduct spoofing or phishing attacks.\n* [CAN-2005-2968](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2968)\nPeter Zelezny discovered that shell metacharacters are not\n properly escaped when they are passed to a shell script and allow\n the execution of arbitrary commands, e.g. when a malicious URL is\n automatically copied from another program into Mozilla as default\n browser.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-2.sarge1.0.7.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.7-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mozilla-thunderbird package.\n\n\n",
