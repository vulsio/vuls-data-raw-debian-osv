	"summary": "python2.2 - design flaw",
	"details": "\nThe Python development team has discovered a flaw in their language\npackage. The SimpleXMLRPCServer library module could permit remote\nattackers unintended access to internals of the registered object or\nits module or possibly other modules. The flaw only affects Python\nXML-RPC servers that use the register\\_instance() method to register an\nobject without a \\_dispatch() method. Servers using only\nregister\\_function() are not affected.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.1-4.7. No other version of Python in woody is affected.\n\n\nFor the testing (sarge) and unstable (sid) distributions the following\nmatrix explains which version will contain the correction in which\nversion:\n\n\n\n\n|  | testing | unstable |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Python 2.2 | 2.2.3-14 | 2.2.3-14 |\n| Python 2.3 | 2.3.4-20 | 2.3.4+2.3.5c1-2 |\n| Python 2.4 | 2.4-5 | 2.4-5 |\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Python packages.\n\n\n",
