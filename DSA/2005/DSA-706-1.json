When reading\nremote input the program did not check if a part of the input can\noverflow a buffer and maybe trigger the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0a-1woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0b-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your axel package.\n\n\n",
