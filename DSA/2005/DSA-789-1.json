The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-1751](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1751)\nEric Romang discovered insecure temporary files in the shtool\n utility shipped with PHP that can exploited by a local attacker to\n overwrite arbitrary files. Only this vulnerability affects\n packages in oldstable.\n\n* [CAN-2005-1921](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1921)\nGulfTech has discovered that PEAR XML\\_RPC is vulnerable to a\n remote PHP code execution vulnerability that may allow an attacker\n to compromise a vulnerable server.\n\n* [CAN-2005-2498](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2498)\nStefan Esser discovered another vulnerability in the XML-RPC\n libraries that allows injection of arbitrary PHP code into eval()\n statements.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.1.2-7.woody5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.3.10-16.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.4.0-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages.\n\n\n",
