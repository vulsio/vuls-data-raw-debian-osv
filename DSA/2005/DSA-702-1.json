	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in ImageMagick, a\ncommonly used image manipulation library. These problems can be\nexploited by a carefully crafted graphic image. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-0397](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0397)\nTavis Ormandy discovered a format string vulnerability in the\n filename handling code which allows a remote attacker to cause a\n denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\n* [CAN-2005-0759](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0759)\nAndrei Nigmatulin discovered a denial of service condition which\n can be caused by an invalid tag in a TIFF image.\n\n* [CAN-2005-0760](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0760)\nAndrei Nigmatulin discovered that the TIFF decoder is vulnerable\n to accessing memory out of bounds which will result in a\n segmentation fault.\n\n* [CAN-2005-0762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0762)\nAndrei Nigmatulin discovered a buffer overflow in the SGI parser\n which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a\n specially crafted SGI image file.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.4.4.5-1woody6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 6.0.6.2-2.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick package.\n\n\n",
