	"details": "\nA vulnerability in mod\\_auth\\_shadow, an Apache module that lets users\nperform HTTP authentication against /etc/shadow, has been discovered.\nThe module runs for all locations that use the 'require group'\ndirective which would bypass access restrictions controlled by another\nauthorisation mechanism, such as AuthGroupFile file, if the username\nis listed in the password file and in the gshadow file in the proper\ngroup and the supplied password matches against the one in the shadow\nfile.\n\n\nThis update requires an explicit \"AuthShadow on\" statement if website\nauthentication should be checked against /etc/shadow.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3-3.1woody.2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4-1sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-auth-shadow package.\n\n\n",
