	"details": "\nErik SjĂślund and Devin Carraway discovered that synaesthesia, a\nprogram for representing sounds visually, accesses user-controlled\nconfiguration and mixer files with elevated privileges. Thus, it is\npossible to read arbitrary files.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1-2.1woody3.\n\n\nFor the testing (sarge) and unstable (sid) distribution this problem\ndoes not exist since synaesthesia is not installed setuid root\nanymore.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your synaesthesia package.\n\n\n",
