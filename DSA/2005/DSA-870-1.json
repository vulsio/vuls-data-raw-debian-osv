	],
	"summary": "sudo - missing input sanitising",
	"details": "\nTavis Ormandy noticed that sudo, a program that provides limited super\nuser privileges to specific users, does not clean the environment\nsufficiently. The SHELLOPTS and PS4 variables are dangerous and are\nstill passed through to the program running as privileged user. This\ncan result in the execution of arbitrary commands as privileged user\nwhen a bash script is executed. These vulnerabilities can only be\nexploited by users who have been granted limited super user\nprivileges.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.6-1.4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.8p7-1.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.8p9-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo package.\n\n\n",
