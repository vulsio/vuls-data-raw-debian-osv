	"summary": "apache - programming error",
	"details": "\nA vulnerability has been discovered in the Apache web server. When it\nis acting as an HTTP proxy, it allows remote attackers to poison the\nweb cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct\ncross-site scripting attacks, which causes Apache to incorrectly\nhandle and forward the body of the request.\n\n\nThe fix for this bug is contained in the apache-common package which means\nthat there isn't any need for a separate update of the apache-perl and\napache-ssl package.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.26-0woody7.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.33-6sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.33-8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Apache package.\n\n\n",
