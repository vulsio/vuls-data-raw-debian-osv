	"summary": "fetchmail - programming error",
	"details": "\nDue to restrictive dependency definition for fetchmail-ssl the updated fetchmailconf\npackage couldn't be installed on the old stable distribution (woody)\ntogether with fetchmail-ssl. Â Hence, this update loosens it, so that\nthe update can be pulled in. Â For completeness we're including the\noriginal advisory text:\n\n\n\n> \n> Thomas Wolff discovered that the fetchmailconf program which is\n> provided as part of fetchmail, an SSL enabled POP3, APOP, IMAP mail\n> gatherer/forwarder, creates the new configuration in an insecure\n> fashion that can lead to leaking passwords for mail accounts to local\n> users.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThis update also fixes a regression in the package for stable caused\nby the last security update.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.9.11-6.4 of fetchmail and in version 5.9.11-6.3 of\nfetchmail-ssl.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.2.5-12sarge3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.2.5.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your fetchmail package.\n\n\n",
