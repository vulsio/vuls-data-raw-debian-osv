	"summary": "krb5 - buffer overflow, double-free memory",
	"details": "\nDaniel Wachdorf reported two problems in the MIT krb5 distribution used\nfor network authentication. First, the KDC program from the krb5-kdc\npackage can corrupt the heap by trying to free memory which has already\nbeen freed on receipt of a certain TCP connection. This vulnerability\ncan cause the KDC to crash, leading to a denial of service.\n[[CAN-2005-1174](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1174)] Second, under certain rare circumstances this type of\nrequest can lead to a buffer overflow and remote code execution.\n[[CAN-2005-1175](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1175)] \n\n\nAdditionally, Magnus Hagander reported another problem in which the\nkrb5\\_recvauth function can in certain circumstances free previously\nfreed memory, potentially leading to the execution of remote code.\n[[CAN-2005-1689](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1689)] \n\n\nAll of these vulnerabilities are believed difficult to exploit, and no\nexploits have yet been discovered.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.2.4-5woody10. Note that woody's KDC does not have TCP\nsupport and is not vulnerable to [CAN-2005-1174](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1174).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.6-2sarge2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.6-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 package.\n\n\n",
