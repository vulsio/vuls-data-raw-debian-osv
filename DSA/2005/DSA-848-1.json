	"details": "\nJens Steube discovered two vulnerabilities in masqmail, a mailer for\nhosts without permanent internet connection. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-2662](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2662)\nWhen sending failed mail messages, the address is not sanitised,\n which allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the\n mail user.\n* [CAN-2005-2663](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2663)\nWhen opening the log file, masqmail does not relinquish\n privileges, which allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary\n files via a symlink attack.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.1.16-2.2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.2.20-1sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.2.20-1sarge1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your masqmail package.\n\n\n",
