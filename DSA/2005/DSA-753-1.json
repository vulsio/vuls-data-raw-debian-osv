	"summary": "gedit - format string",
	"details": "\nA format string vulnerability has been discovered in gedit, a\nlight-weight text editor for GNOME, that may allow attackers to cause\na denial of service (application crash) via a binary file with format\nstring specifiers in the filename. Since gedit supports opening files\nvia \"http://\" URLs (through GNOME vfs) and other schemes, this might\nbe a remotely exploitable vulnerability.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not vulnerable to this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.8.3-4sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.10.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gedit package.\n\n\n",
