	"details": "\nJens Steube discovered several vulnerabilities in remstats, the remote\nstatistics system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-0387](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0387)\nWhen processing uptime data on the unix-server a temporary file is\n opened in an insecure fashion which could be used for a symlink\n attack to create or overwrite arbitrary files with the permissions\n of the remstats user.\n\n* [CAN-2005-0388](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0388)\nThe remoteping service can be exploited to execute arbitrary\n commands due to missing input sanitising.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.00a4-8woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.13a-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your remstats packages.\n\n\n",
