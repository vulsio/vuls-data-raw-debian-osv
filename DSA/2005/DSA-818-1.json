This leaves them open for symlink attacks.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.3.2-3.sarge.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.4.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kvoctrain package.\n\n\n",
