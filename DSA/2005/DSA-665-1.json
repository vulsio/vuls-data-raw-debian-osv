Due to accessing a configuration file\nwithout further checks with root permissions it is possible to read\narbitrary files.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.0.18-10woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ncpfs package.\n\n\n",
