	"details": "\nSeveral problems have been discovered in pdns, a versatile nameserver\nthat can lead to a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-2301](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2301)\nNorbert Sendetzky and Jan de Groot discovered that the LDAP backend\n did not properly escape all queries, allowing it to fail and not\n answer queries anymore.\n\n* [CAN-2005-2302](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2302)\nWilco Baan discovered that queries from clients without recursion\n permission can temporarily blank out domains to clients with\n recursion permitted. This enables outside users to blank out a\n domain temporarily to normal users.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdns packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.9.17-13sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.9.18-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pdns package.\n\n\n",
