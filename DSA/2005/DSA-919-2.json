The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n> identifies the following problems:\n> \n> \n> * [CVE-2005-3185](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3185)\n> A buffer overflow has been discovered in libcurl\n>  that could allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n> * [CVE-2005-4077](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4077)\n> Stefan Esser discovered several off-by-one errors that allows\n>  local users to trigger a buffer overflow and cause a denial of\n>  service or bypass PHP security restrictions via certain URLs.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.9.5-1woody2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.13.2-2sarge5. This update also includes a bugfix against\ndata corruption.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.15.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libcurl packages.\n\n\n",
