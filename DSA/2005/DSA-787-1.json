	"summary": "backup-manager - insecure permissions and tempfile",
	"details": "\nTwo bugs have been found in backup-manager, a command-line driven\nbackup utility. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-1855](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1855)\nJeroen Vermeulen discovered that backup files are created with\n default permissions making them world readable, even though they\n may contain sensitive information.\n\n* [CAN-2005-1856](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1856)\nSven Joachim discovered that the optional CD-burning feature of\n backup-manager uses a hardcoded filename in a world-writable\n directory for logging. This can be subject to a symlink attack.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not provide the\nbackup-manager package.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.5.7-1sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.5.8-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your backup-manager package.\n\n\n",
