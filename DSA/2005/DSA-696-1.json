When a process is\ndeleting a directory tree, a different user could exploit a race\ncondition to create setuid binaries in this directory tree, provided\nthat he already had write permissions in any subdirectory of that\ntree.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.6.1-8.9.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.8.4-8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.\n\n\n",
