	"details": "\nTwo problems have been discovered in the libpam-radius-auth package,\nthe PAM RADIUS authentication module. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures Project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-1340](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1340)\nThe Debian package accidentally installed its configuration file\n /etc/pam\\_radius\\_auth.conf world-readable. Since it may possibly\n contain secrets all local users are able to read them if the\n administrator hasn't adjusted file permissions. This problem is\n Debian specific.\n\n* [CAN-2005-0108](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0108)\nLeon Juranic discovered an integer underflow in the mod\\_auth\\_radius\n module for Apache which is also present in libpam-radius-auth.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.14-1.3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.16-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpam-radius-auth package.\n\n\n",
