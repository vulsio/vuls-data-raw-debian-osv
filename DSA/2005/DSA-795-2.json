	"summary": "proftpd - format string error",
	"details": "\ninfamous42md reported that proftpd suffers from two format string\nvulnerabilities. In the first, a user with the ability to create a\ndirectory could trigger the format string error if there is a\nproftpd shutdown message configured to use the \"%C\", \"%R\", or \"%U\"\nvariables. In the second, the error is triggered if mod\\_sql is used\nto retrieve messages from a database and if format strings have been\ninserted into the database by a user with permission to do so.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these\nvulnerabilities.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.10-15sarge1. There was an error in the packages originally\nprepared for i386, which was corrected in 1.2.10-15sarge1.0.1 for i386.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.10-20.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your proftpd package.\n\n\n",
