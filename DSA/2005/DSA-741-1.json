	"summary": "bzip2 - infinite loop",
	"details": "\nChris Evans discovered that a specially crafted archive can trigger an\ninfinite loop in bzip2, a high-quality block-sorting file compressor.\nDuring uncompression this results in an indefinitely growing output\nfile which will finally fill up the disk. On systems that\nautomatically decompress bzip2 archives this can cause a denial of\nservice.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-1.woody5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-7.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.2-7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bzip2 package.\n\n\n",
