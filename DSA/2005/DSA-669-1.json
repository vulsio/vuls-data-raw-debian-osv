The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-0594](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0594)\nThe memory\\_limit functionality allows remote attackers to execute\n arbitrary code under certain circumstances.\n\n* [CAN-2004-0595](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0595)\nThe strip\\_tags function does not filter null (\\0) characters\n within tag names when restricting input to allowed tags, which\n allows dangerous tags to be processed by some web browsers which\n could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.0.18-23.1woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.0.18-27.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php3 packages.\n\n\n",
