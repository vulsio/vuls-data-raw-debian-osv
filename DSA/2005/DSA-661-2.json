For\ncompleteness below is the original advisory text:\n\n\n\n> \n> Javier FernĂĄndez-Sanguino PeĂąa from the Debian Security Audit project\n> discovered that f2c and fc, which are both part of the f2c package, a\n> fortran 77 to C/C++ translator, open temporary files insecurely and\n> are hence vulnerable to a symlink attack. The Common\n> Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\n> vulnerabilities:\n> \n> \n> * [CAN-2005-0017](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0017)\n> Multiple insecure temporary files in the f2c translator.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-0018](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0018)\n> Two insecure temporary files in the f2 shell script.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) and all others including testing\nthis problem has been fixed in version 20010821-3.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your f2c package.\n\n\n",
