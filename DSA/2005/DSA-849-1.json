	"details": "\n\"Supernaut\" noticed that shorewall, the Shoreline Firewall, could\ngenerate an iptables configuration which is significantly more\npermissive than the rule set given in the shorewall configuration, if\nMAC verification are used in a non-default manner.\n\n\nWhen MACLIST\\_DISPOSITION is set to ACCEPT in the shorewall.conf file,\nall packets from hosts which fail the MAC verification pass through\nthe firewall, without further checks. When MACLIST\\_TTL is set to a\nnon-zero value, packets from hosts which pass the MAC verification\npass through the firewall, again without further checks.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.3-2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.1-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your shorewall package.\n\n\n",
