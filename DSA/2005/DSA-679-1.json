The\nproblems exist inside the Debian-specific tpkg-\\* scripts.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.0.4-1woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.4-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your toolchain-source package.\n\n\n",
