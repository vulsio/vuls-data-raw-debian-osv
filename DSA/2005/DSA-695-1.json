This problem\n has already been fixed in xloadimage in\n [DSA 069](../2001/dsa-069).\n\n* [CAN-2005-0638](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0638)\nTavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team has reported\n a flaw in the handling of compressed images, where shell\n meta-characters are not adequately escaped.\n\n* [CAN-2005-0639](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0639)\nInsufficient validation of image properties in have been\n discovered which could potentially result in buffer management\n errors.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.17.0-11woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.17.0-18.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xli package.\n\n\n",
