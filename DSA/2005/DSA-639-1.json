Samoilov has noticed that several bugfixes which were\napplied to the source by upstream developers of mc, the midnight\ncommander, a file browser and manager, were not backported to the\ncurrent version of mc that Debian ships in their stable release. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies the following\nvulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-1004](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1004)\nMultiple format string vulnerabilities\n\n* [CAN-2004-1005](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1005)\nMultiple buffer overflows\n\n* [CAN-2004-1009](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1009)\nOne infinite loop vulnerability\n\n* [CAN-2004-1090](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1090)\nDenial of service via corrupted section header\n\n* [CAN-2004-1091](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1091)\nDenial of service via null dereference\n\n* [CAN-2004-1092](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1092)\nFreeing unallocated memory\n\n* [CAN-2004-1093](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1093)\nDenial of service via use of already freed memory\n\n* [CAN-2004-1174](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1174)\nDenial of service via manipulating non-existing file handles\n\n* [CAN-2004-1175](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1175)\nUnintended program execution via insecure filename quoting\n\n* [CAN-2004-1176](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1176)\nDenial of service via a buffer underflow\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.5.55-1.2woody5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems should already be\nfixed since they were backported from current versions.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mc package.\n\n\n",
