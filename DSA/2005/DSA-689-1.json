	"details": "\nGraham Dumpleton discovered a flaw which can affect anyone using the\npublisher handle of the Apache Software Foundation's mod\\_python. The\npublisher handle lets you publish objects inside modules to make them\ncallable via URL. The flaw allows a carefully crafted URL to obtain\nextra information that should not be visible (information leak).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.7.8-0.0woody5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.7.10-4 of libapache-mod-python and in version 3.1.3-3 of\nlibapache2-mod-python.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-python package.\n\n\n",
