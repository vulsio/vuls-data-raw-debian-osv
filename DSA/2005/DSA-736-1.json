	"details": "\nA vulnerability was recently found in the way that SpamAssassin parses\ncertain email headers. This vulnerability could cause SpamAssassin to\nconsume a large number of CPU cycles when processing messages containing\nthese headers, leading to a potential denial of service (DOS) attack. \n\n\nThe version of SpamAssassin in the old stable distribution (woody) is\nnot vulnerable.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.0.3-2. Note that packages are not yet ready for certain\narchitectures; these will be released as they become available.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.0.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sarge or sid spamassassin package.\n\n\n",
