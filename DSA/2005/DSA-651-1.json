	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid, the internet\nobject cache, the popular WWW proxy cache. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures Project identifies the following vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-0094](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0094)\n\"infamous41md\" discovered a buffer overflow in the parser for\n Gopher responses which will lead to memory corruption and usually\n crash Squid.\n\n* [CAN-2005-0095](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0095)\n\"infamous41md\" discovered an integer overflow in the receiver of\n WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol) messages. An attacker\n could send a specially crafted UDP datagram that will cause Squid\n to crash.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.6-2woody5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.5.7-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid package.\n\n\n",
