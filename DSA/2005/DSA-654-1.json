	"summary": "enscript - several",
	"details": "\nErik SjĂślund has discovered several security relevant problems in\nenscript, a program to convert ASCII text into Postscript and other\nformats. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-1184](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1184)\nUnsanitised input can cause the execution of arbitrary commands\n via EPSF pipe support. This has been disabled, also upstream.\n\n* [CAN-2004-1185](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1185)\nDue to missing sanitising of filenames it is possible that a\n specially crafted filename can cause arbitrary commands to be\n executed.\n\n* [CAN-2004-1186](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1186)\nMultiple buffer overflows can cause the program to crash.\n\n\nUsually, enscript is only run locally, but since it is executed inside\nof viewcvs some of the problems mentioned above can easily be turned\ninto a remote vulnerability.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.3-1.3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.6.4-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your enscript package.\n\n\n",
