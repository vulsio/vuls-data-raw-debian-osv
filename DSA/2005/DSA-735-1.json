	"summary": "sudo - pathname validation race",
	"details": "\nA local user who has been granted permission to run commands via sudo\ncould run arbitrary commands as a privileged user due to a flaw in\nsudo's pathname validation. This bug only affects configurations which\nhave restricted user configurations prior to an ALL directive in the\nconfiguration file. A workaround is to move any ALL directives to the\nbeginning of the sudoers file; see the advisory at\n for more information.\n\n\nFor the old stable Debian distribution (woody), this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.6.6-1.3woody1.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution\n(sarge), this problem has been fixed in version 1.6.8p7-1.1sarge1.\n\n\nNote that packages are not yet ready for certain architectures; these\nwill be released as they become available.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sudo package.\n\n\n",
