This can be tricked into opening a root shell.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 0.2001080415-6woody2 (DSA 725-1).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.2001080415-10sarge2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.2001080415-11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ppxp package.\n\n\n",
