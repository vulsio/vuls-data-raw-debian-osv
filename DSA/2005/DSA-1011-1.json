	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Debian vserver\nsupport for Linux. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2005-4347](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4347)\nBjĂ¸rn Steinbrink discovered that the chroot barrier is not set\n correctly with util-vserver which may result in unauthorised\n escapes from a vserver to the host system.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is limited to the 2.4 kernel patch included in\n kernel-patch-vserver. The correction to this problem requires\n updating the util-vserver package as well and installing a new\n kernel built from the updated kernel-patch-vserver package.\n* [CVE-2005-4418](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4418)\nThe default policy of util-vserver is set to trust all unknown\n capabilities instead of considering them as insecure.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a\nkernel-patch-vserver package.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.9.5.5 of kernel-patch-vserver and in version\n0.30.204-5sarge3 of util-vserver.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3 of kernel-patch-vserver and in version 0.30.208-1 of\nutil-vserver.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your util-vserver and\nkernel-patch-vserver packages and build a new kernel immediately.\n\n\n",
