	"details": "\nSimon Nielsen discovered that the BGP dissector in tcpdump, a powerful\ntool for network monitoring and data acquisition, does not properly\nhandle a -1 return value from an internal function that decodes data\npackets. A specially crafted BGP packet can cause a denial of service\nvia an infinite loop.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.8.3-5sarge1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump package.\n\n\n",
