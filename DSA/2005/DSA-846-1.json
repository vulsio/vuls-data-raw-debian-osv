	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities have been discovered in cpio, a program to manage\narchives of files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-1111](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1111)\nImran Ghory discovered a race condition in setting the file\n permissions of files extracted from cpio archives. A local\n attacker with write access to the target directory could exploit\n this to alter the permissions of arbitrary files the extracting\n user has write permissions for.\n* [CAN-2005-1229](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1229)\nImran Ghory discovered that cpio does not sanitise the path of\n extracted files even if the --no-absolute-filenames option was\n specified. This can be exploited to install files in arbitrary\n locations where the extracting user has write permissions to.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.2-39woody2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.5-1.3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cpio package.\n\n\n",
