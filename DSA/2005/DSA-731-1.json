This can lead to the\n execution of arbitrary code when connected to a malicious server.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1-8-2.4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.2-11.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.2-11.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb4 packages.\n\n\n",
