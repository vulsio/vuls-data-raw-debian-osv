The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-1545](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1545)\nTavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Team discovered an\n integer overflow in the ELF parser.\n\n* [CAN-2005-1546](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1546)\nThe authors have discovered a buffer overflow in the PE parser.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.5.0-1woody4. For the HP Precision architecture, you are\nadvised not to use this package anymore since we cannot provide\nupdated packages as it doesn't compile anymore.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.8.0-2sarge4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.8.0-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ht package.\n\n\n",
