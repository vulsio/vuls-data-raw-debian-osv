	"details": "\niDEFENSE has reported a buffer overflow in xpdf, the portable document\nformat (PDF) suite. Similar code is present in the PDF processing\npart of CUPS. A maliciously crafted PDF file could exploit this\nproblem, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.14-5woody12.\n\n\nIn the unstable distribution (sid) CUPSYS does not use its own xpdf\nvariant anymore but uses xpdf-utils.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.\n\n\n",
