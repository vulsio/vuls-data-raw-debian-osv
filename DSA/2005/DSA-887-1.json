The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2005-3239](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3239)\nThe OLE2 unpacker allows remote attackers to cause a segmentation\n fault via a DOC file with an invalid property tree, which triggers\n an infinite recursion.\n* [CVE-2005-3303](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3303)\nA specially crafted executable compressed with FSG 1.33 could\n cause the extractor to write beyond buffer boundaries, allowing an\n attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2005-3500](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3500)\nA specially crafted CAB file could cause ClamAV to be locked in an\n infinite loop and use all available processor resources, resulting\n in a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2005-3501](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3501)\nA specially crafted CAB file could cause ClamAV to be locked in an\n infinite loop and use all available processor resources, resulting\n in a denial of service.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain clamav packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.84-2.sarge.6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.87.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.\n\n\n",
