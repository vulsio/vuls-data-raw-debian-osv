	],
	"summary": "imlib2 - integer overflows",
	"details": "\nPavel Kankovsky discovered that several overflows found in the libXpm\nlibrary were also present in imlib and imlib2, imaging libraries for\nX11. An attacker could create a carefully crafted image file in such\na way that it could cause an application linked with imlib or imlib2\nto execute arbitrary code when the file was opened by a victim. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2004-1025](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1025)\nMultiple heap-based buffer overflows. No such code is present in\n imlib2.\n\n* [CAN-2004-1026](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1026)\nMultiple integer overflows in the imlib library.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.5-2woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your imlib2 packages.\n\n\n",
