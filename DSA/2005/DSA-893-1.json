	"details": "\nRemco Verhoef has discovered a vulnerability in acidlab, Analysis\nConsole for Intrusion Databases, and in acidbase, Basic Analysis and\nSecurity Engine, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct\nSQL injection attacks.\n\n\nThe maintainers of Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) in Debian,\nof which BASE is a fork off, after a security audit of both BASE and ACID\nhave determined that the flaw found not only affected the base\\_qry\\_main.php (in\nBASE) or acid\\_qry\\_main.php (in ACID) component but was also found in other\nelements of the consoles due to improper parameter validation and filtering.\n\n\nAll the SQL injection bugs and Cross Site Scripting bugs found have been\nfixed in the Debian package, closing all the different attack vectors detected.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.6b20-2.1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.6b20-10.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.6b20-13 and in version 1.2.1-1 of acidbase.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your acidlab and acidbase package.\n\n\n",
