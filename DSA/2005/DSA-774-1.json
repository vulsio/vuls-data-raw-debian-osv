	"details": "\nEdward Shornock discovered a bug in the UIDL handling code of\nfetchmail, a common POP3, APOP and IMAP mail fetching utility. A\nmalicious POP3 server could exploit this problem and inject arbitrary\ncode that will be executed on the victim host. If fetchmail is\nrunning as root, this becomes a root exploit.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.2.5-12sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 6.2.5-16.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your fetchmail package.\n\n\n",
