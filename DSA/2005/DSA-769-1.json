	"summary": "gaim - memory alignment bug",
	"details": "\nSzymon Zygmunt and Michal Bartoszkiewicz discovered a memory alignment\nerror in libgadu (from ekg, console Gadu Gadu client, an instant\nmessaging program) which is included in gaim, a multi-protocol instant\nmessaging client, as well. This can not be exploited on the x86\narchitecture but on others, e.g. on Sparc and lead to a bus error,\nin other words a denial of service.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by\nthis problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.1-1.4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gaim package.\n\n\n",
