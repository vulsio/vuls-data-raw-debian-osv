	"details": "\nSeveral local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the\nLinux kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of\narbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2004-2302](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-2302)\nA race condition in the sysfs filesystem allows local users to\n read kernel memory and cause a denial of service (crash).\n\n* [CVE-2005-0756](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0756)\nAlexander Nyberg discovered that the ptrace() system call does not\n properly verify addresses on the amd64 architecture which can be\n exploited by a local attacker to crash the kernel.\n* [CVE-2005-0757](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0757)\nA problem in the offset handling in the xattr file system code for\n ext3 has been discovered that may allow users on 64-bit systems\n that have access to an ext3 filesystem with extended attributes to\n cause the kernel to crash.\n* [CVE-2005-1265](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1265)\nChris Wright discovered that the mmap() function could create\n illegal memory maps that could be exploited by a local user to\n crash the kernel or potentially execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2005-1761](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1761)\nA vulnerability on the IA-64 architecture can lead local attackers\n to overwrite kernel memory and crash the kernel.\n* [CVE-2005-1762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1762)\nA vulnerability has been discovered in the ptrace() system call on\n the amd64 architecture that allows a local attacker to cause the\n kernel to crash.\n* [CVE-2005-1763](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1763)\nA buffer overflow in the ptrace system call for 64-bit\n architectures allows local users to write bytes into arbitrary\n kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2005-1765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1765)\nZou Nan Hai has discovered that a local user could cause the\n kernel to hang on the amd64 architecture after invoking syscall()\n with specially crafted arguments.\n* [CVE-2005-1767](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1767)\nA vulnerability has been discovered in the stack segment fault\n handler that could allow a local attacker to cause a stack exception\n that will lead the kernel to crash under certain circumstances.\n* [CVE-2005-2456](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2456)\nBalazs Scheidler discovered that a local attacker could call\n setsockopt() with an invalid xfrm\\_user policy message which would\n cause the kernel to write beyond the boundaries of an array and\n crash.\n* [CVE-2005-2458](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2458)\nVladimir Volovich discovered a bug in the zlib routines which are\n also present in the Linux kernel and allows remote attackers to\n crash the kernel.\n* [CVE-2005-2459](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2459)\nAnother vulnerability has been discovered in the zlib routines\n which are also present in the Linux kernel and allows remote\n attackers to crash the kernel.\n* [CVE-2005-2548](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2548)\nPeter Sandstrom noticed that snmpwalk from a remote host could\n cause a denial of service (kernel oops from null dereference) via\n certain UDP packets that lead to a function call with the wrong\n argument.\n* [CVE-2005-2801](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2801)\nAndreas Gruenbacher discovered a bug in the ext2 and ext3 file\n systems. When data areas are to be shared among two inodes not\n all information were compared for equality, which could expose\n wrong ACLs for files.\n* [CVE-2005-2872](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2872)\nChad Walstrom discovered that the ipt\\_recent kernel module on\n 64-bit processors such as AMD64 allows remote attackers to cause a\n denial of service (kernel panic) via certain attacks such as SSH\n brute force.\n* [CVE-2005-3105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3105)\nThe mprotect code on Itanium IA-64 Montecito processors does not\n properly maintain cache coherency as required by the architecture,\n which allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly\n corrupt data by modifying PTE protections.\n* [CVE-2005-3106](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3106)\nA race condition in the thread management may allow local users to\n cause a denial of service (deadlock) when threads are sharing\n memory and waiting for a thread that has just performed an exec.\n* [CVE-2005-3107](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3107)\nWhen one thread is tracing another thread that shares the same\n memory map a local user could cause a denial of service (deadlock)\n by forcing a core dump when the traced thread is in the\n TASK\\_TRACED state.\n* [CVE-2005-3108](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3108)\nA bug in the ioremap() system call has been discovered on the\n amd64 architecture that could allow local users to cause a\n denial of service or an information leak when performing a lookup\n of a non-existent memory page.\n* [CVE-2005-3109](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3109)\nThe HFS and HFS+ (hfsplus) modules allow local attackers to cause\n a denial of service (oops) by using hfsplus to mount a filesystem\n that is not hfsplus.\n* [CVE-2005-3110](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3110)\nA race condition in the ebtables netfilter module on an SMP system\n running under high load may allow remote attackers to cause a\n denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2005-3271](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3271)\nRoland McGrath discovered that exec() does not properly clear\n posix-timers in multi-threaded environments, which results in a\n resource leak and could allow a large number of multiple local\n users to cause a denial of service by using more posix-timers than\n specified by the quota for a single user.\n* [CVE-2005-3272](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3272)\nThe kernel allows remote attackers to poison the bridge forwarding\n table using frames that have already been dropped by filtering,\n which can cause the bridge to forward spoofed packets.\n* [CVE-2005-3273](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3273)\nThe ioctl for the packet radio ROSE protocol does not properly\n verify the arguments when setting a new router, which allows\n attackers to trigger out-of-bounds errors.\n* [CVE-2005-3274](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3274)\nA race condition on SMP systems allows local users to cause a\n denial of service (null dereference) by causing a connection timer\n to expire while the connection table is being flushed before the\n appropriate lock is acquired.\n* [CVE-2005-3275](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3275)\nAn error in the NAT code allows remote attackers to cause a denial\n of service (memory corruption) by causing two packets for the same\n protocol to be NATed at the same time, which leads to memory\n corruption.\n* [CVE-2005-3276](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3276)\nA missing memory cleanup in the thread handling routines before\n copying data into userspace allows a user process to obtain\n sensitive information.\n\n\nThis update also contains a number of corrections for issues that\nturned out to have no security implication afterwards.\n\n\nThe following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture\nfix the problems mentioned above:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 3.1 (sarge) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Source | 2.6.8-16sarge1 |\n| Alpha architecture | 2.6.8-16sarge1 |\n| AMD64 architecture | 2.6.8-16sarge1 |\n| HP Precision architecture | 2.6.8-6sarge1 |\n| Intel IA-32 architecture | 2.6.8-16sarge1 |\n| Intel IA-64 architecture | 2.6.8-14sarge1 |\n| Motorola 680x0 architecture | 2.6.8-4sarge1 |\n| PowerPC architecture | 2.6.8-12sarge1 |\n| IBM S/390 architecture | 2.6.8-5sarge1 |\n| Sun Sparc architecture | 2.6.8-15sarge1 |\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and\nreboot the machine.\n\n\n",
