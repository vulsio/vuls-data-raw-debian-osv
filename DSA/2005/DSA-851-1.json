	"details": "\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in openvpn, a\nVirtual Private Network daemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-2531](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2531)\nWrong processing of failed certificate authentication when running\n with \"verb 0\" and without TLS authentication can lead to a denial\n of service by disconnecting the wrong client.\n* [CAN-2005-2532](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2532)\nWrong handling of packets that can't be decrypted on the server\n can lead to the disconnection of unrelated clients.\n* [CAN-2005-2533](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2533)\nWhen running in \"dev tap\" Ethernet bridging mode, openvpn can\n exhaust its memory by receiving a large number of spoofed MAC\n addresses and hence denying service.\n* [CAN-2005-2534](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2534)\nSimultaneous TCP connections from multiple clients with the same\n client certificate can cause a denial of service when\n `--duplicate-cn` is not enabled.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain openvpn packages.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0-1sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openvpn package.\n\n\n",
