	"details": "\nTwo problems have been discovered in gzip, the GNU compression\nutility. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems.\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-0988](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0988)\nImran Ghory discovered a race condition in the permissions setting\n code in gzip. When decompressing a file in a directory an\n attacker has access to, gunzip could be tricked to set the file\n permissions to a different file the user has permissions to.\n\n* [CAN-2005-1228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1228)\nUlf HĂ¤rnhammar discovered a path traversal vulnerability in\n gunzip. When gunzip is used with the -N option an attacker could\n use\n this vulnerability to create files in an arbitrary directory with\n the permissions of the user.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.2-3woody5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.5-10.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3.5-10.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gzip package.\n\n\n",
