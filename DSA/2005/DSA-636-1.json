Trustix developers found that the catchsegv\nscript uses temporary files insecurely. Openwall developers\ndiscovered insecure temporary files in the glibcbug script. These\nscripts are vulnerable to a symlink attack.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.5-11.8.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.3.2.ds1-20.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libc6 package.\n\n\n",
