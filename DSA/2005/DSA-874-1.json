	"details": "\nUlf HĂ¤rnhammar discovered a buffer overflow in lynx, a text-mode\nbrowser for the WWW that can be remotely exploited. During the\nhandling of Asian characters when connecting to an NNTP server lynx\ncan be tricked to write past the boundary of a buffer which can lead\nto the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.8.4.1b-3.3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.8.5-2sarge1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lynx package.\n\n\n",
