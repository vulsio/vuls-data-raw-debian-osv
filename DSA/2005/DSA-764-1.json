The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2005-1524](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1524)\nMaciej Piotr Falkiewicz and an anonymous researcher discovered an\n input validation bug that allows an attacker to include arbitrary\n PHP code from remote sites which will allow the execution of\n arbitrary code on the server running cacti.\n\n* [CAN-2005-1525](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1525)\nDue to missing input validation cacti allows a remote attacker to\n insert arbitrary SQL statements.\n\n* [CAN-2005-1526](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1526)\nMaciej Piotr Falkiewicz discovered an input validation bug that\n allows an attacker to include arbitrary PHP code from remote sites\n which will allow the execution of arbitrary code on the server\n running cacti.\n\n* [CAN-2005-2148](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2148)\nStefan Esser discovered that the update for the above mentioned\n vulnerabilities does not perform proper input validation to\n protect against common attacks.\n\n* [CAN-2005-2149](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2149)\nStefan Esser discovered that the update for [CAN-2005-1525](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1525) allows\n remote attackers to modify session information to gain privileges\n and disable the use of addslashes to protect against SQL\n injection.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.6.7-2.5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.8.6c-7sarge2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.8.6f-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cacti package.\n\n\n",
