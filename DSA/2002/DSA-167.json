	"summary": "kdelibs - cross site scripting",
	"details": "\nA cross site scripting problem has been discovered in Konqueror, a\nfamous browser for KDE and other programs using KHTML. The KDE team\n[reports](http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20020908-2.txt)\nthat Konqueror's cross site scripting protection fails to\ninitialize the domains on sub-(i)frames correctly. As a result,\nJavaScript is able to access any foreign subframe which is defined in\nthe HTML source. Users of Konqueror and other KDE software that uses\nthe KHTML rendering engine may become victim of a cookie stealing and\nother cross site scripting attacks.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 2.2.2-13.woody.3 for the\ncurrent stable distribution (woody) and in version 2.2.2-14 for the\nunstable distribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is\nnot affected since it didn't ship KDE.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs package and restart\nKonqueror.\n\n\n",
