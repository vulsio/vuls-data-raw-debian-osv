	"summary": "openafs - integer overflow",
	"details": "\nAn integer overflow bug has been discovered in the RPC library used by\nthe OpenAFS database server, which is derived from the SunRPC library.\nThis bug could be exploited to crash certain OpenAFS servers\n(volserver, vlserver, ptserver, buserver) or to obtain unauthorized\nroot access to a host running one of these processes. No exploits are\nknown to exist yet.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 1.2.3final2-6 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 1.2.6-1 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). Debian 2.2 (potato) is not affected since it\ndoesn't contain OpenAFS packages.\n\n\nOpenAFS is only available for the architectures alpha, i386, powerpc,\ns390, sparc. Hence, we only provide fixed packages for these\narchitectures.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.\n\n\n",
