	"summary": "perl - broken safe compartment",
	"details": "\nA security hole has been discovered in Safe.pm which is used in all\nversions of Perl. The Safe extension module allows the creation of\ncompartments in which perl code can be evaluated in a new namespace\nand the code evaluated in the compartment cannot refer to variables\noutside this namespace. However, when a Safe compartment has already\nbeen used, there's no guarantee that it is Safe any longer, because\nthere's a way for code to be executed within the Safe compartment to\nalter its operation mask. Thus, programs that use a Safe compartment\nonly once aren't affected by this bug.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 5.6.1-8.2 for the current\nstable distribution (woody), in version 5.004.05-6.2 and 5.005.03-7.2\nfor the old stable distribution (potato) and in version 5.8.0-14 for\nthe unstable distribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Perl packages.\n\n\n",
