	"details": "\nCurrent versions of l2tpd, a layer 2 tunneling client/server program,\nforgot to initialize the random generator which made it vulnerable\nsince all generated random number were 100% guessable. When dealing\nwith the size of the value in an attribute value pair, too many bytes\nwere able to be copied, which could lead into the vendor field being\noverwritten.\n\n\nThese problems have been fixed in version 0.67-1.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 0.68-1 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is not\naffected, since it doesn't contain the l2tpd package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your l2tpd packages.\n\n\n",
