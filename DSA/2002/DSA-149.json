	"summary": "glibc - integer overflow",
	"details": "\nAn integer overflow bug has been discovered in the RPC library used by\nGNU libc, which is derived from the SunRPC library. This bug could be\nexploited to gain unauthorized root access to software linking to this\ncode. The packages below also fix integer overflows in the malloc\ncode. They also contain a fix from Andreas Schwab to reduce\nlinebuflen in parallel to bumping up the buffer pointer in the NSS DNS\ncode.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 2.1.3-23 for the old stable\ndistribution (potato), in version 2.2.5-11.1 for the current stable\ndistribution (woody) and in version 2.2.5-13 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libc6 packages immediately.\n\n\n",
