The implementation of the rlogin and telnet\nprotocols allows a carefully crafted URL in an HTML page, HTML email or\nother KIO-enabled application to execute arbitrary commands on the\nsystem using the victim's account on the vulnerable machine.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed by disabling rlogin and telnet in version\n2.2.2-13.woody.5 for the current stable distribution (woody). The old\nstable distribution (potato) is not affected since it doesn't contain\nKDE. A correction for the package in the unstable distribution (sid)\nis not yet available.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs3 package immediately.\n\n\n",
