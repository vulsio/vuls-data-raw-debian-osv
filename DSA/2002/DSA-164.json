	"details": "\nA problem in cacti, a PHP based frontend to rrdtool for monitoring\nsystems and services, has been discovered. This could lead into cacti\nexecuting arbitrary program code under the user id of the web server.\nThis problem, however, is only persistent to users who already have\nadministrator privileges in the cacti system.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed by removing any dollar signs and backticks\nfrom the title string in version 0.6.7-2.1 for the current stable\ndistribution (woody) and in version 0.6.8a-2 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is not\naffected since it doesn't contain the cacti package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cacti package immediately.\n\n\n",
