	"details": "\nThe SuSE Security Team has reviewed critical parts of the Heimdal\npackage such as the kadmind and kdc server. While doing so several\npotential buffer overflows and other bugs have been uncovered and\nfixed. Remote attackers can probably gain remote root access on\nsystems without fixes. Since these services usually run on\nauthentication servers these bugs are considered very serious.\n\n\nThese problems have been fixed in version 0.4e-7.woody.4 for the\ncurrent stable distribution (woody), in version 0.2l-7.4 for the old\nstable distribution (potato) and version 0.4e-21 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Heimdal packages immediately.\n\n\n",
