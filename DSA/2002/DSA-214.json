	"summary": "kdenetwork - buffer overflows",
	"details": "\nOlaf Kirch from SuSE Linux AG discovered another vulnerability in the\nklisa package, that provides a LAN information service similar to\n\"Network Neighbourhood\". The lisa daemon contains a buffer overflow\nvulnerability which potentially enables any local user, as well as\nany remote attacker on the LAN who is able to gain control of the LISa\nport (7741 by default), to obtain root privileges. In addition, a\nremote attacker potentially may be able to gain access to a victim's\naccount by using an \"rlan://\" URL in an HTML page or via another KDE\napplication.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 2.2.2-14.5 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 2.2.2-14.20 for the\nunstable distribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is\nnot affected since it doesn't contain a kdenetwork package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your klisa package immediately.\n\n\n",
