Christey discovered that wget did not verify the FTP server\n response to a NLST command: it must not contain any directory information,\n since that can be used to make an FTP client overwrite arbitrary files.\n\n\nBoth problems have been fixed in version 1.5.3-3.1 for Debian GNU/Linux\n2.2/potato and version 1.8.1-6.1 for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody.\n\n\n",
