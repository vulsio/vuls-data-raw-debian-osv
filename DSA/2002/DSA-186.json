	"summary": "log2mail - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nEnrico Zini discovered a buffer overflow in log2mail, a daemon for\nwatching logfiles and sending lines with matching patterns via mail.\nThe log2mail daemon is started upon system boot and runs as root. A\nspecially crafted (remote) log message could overflow a static buffer,\npotentially leaving log2mail to execute arbitrary code as root.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 0.2.5.1 the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 0.2.6-1 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is not\naffected since it doesn't contain a log2mail package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your log2mail package.\n\n\n",
