	"details": "\nZen-parse discovered a buffer overflow in gv, a PostScript and PDF\nviewer for X11. This problem is triggered by scanning the PostScript\nfile and can be exploited by an attacker sending a malformed\nPostScript or PDF file. The attacker is able to cause arbitrary code\nto be run with the privileges of the victim.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 3.5.8-26.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody), in version 3.5.8-17.1 for the old stable\ndistribution (potato) and version 3.5.8-27 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gv package.\n\n\n",
