	"summary": "nullmailer - denial of service",
	"details": "\nA problem has been discovered in nullmailer, a simple relay-only mail\ntransport agent for hosts that relay mail to a fixed set of smart\nrelays. When a mail is to be delivered locally to a user that doesn't\nexist, nullmailer tries to deliver it, discovers a user unknown error\nand stops delivering. Unfortunately, it stops delivering entirely,\nnot only this mail. Hence, it's very easy to craft a denial of service.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 1.00RC5-16.1woody2 for the\ncurrent stable distribution (woody) and in version 1.00RC5-17 for the\nunstable distribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato)\ndoes not contain a nullmailer package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nullmailer package.\n\n\n",
