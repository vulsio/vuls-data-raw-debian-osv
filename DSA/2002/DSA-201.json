IPSEC is a set of\nsecurity extensions to IP which provide authentication and encryption.\nFree/SWan in Debian is affected by this and is said to cause a kernel\npanic.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 1.96-1.4 for the current stable\ndistribution (woody) and in version 1.99-1 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) does not\ncontain Free/SWan packages.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your freeswan package.\n\n\n",
