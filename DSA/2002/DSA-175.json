	"details": "\nBalazs Scheidler [\\\ndiscovered](http://www.balabit.hu/static/zsa/ZSA-2002-014-en.txt) a problem in the way syslog-ng handles macro\nexpansion. When a macro is expanded a static length buffer is used\naccompanied by a counter. However, when constant characters are\nappended, the counter is not updated properly, leading to incorrect\nboundary checking. An attacker may be able to use specially crafted\nlog messages inserted via UDP which overflows the buffer.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 1.5.15-1.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody), in version 1.4.0rc3-3.2 for the old\nstable distribution (potato) and version 1.5.21-1 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your syslog-ng package immediately.\n\n\n",
