	"details": "\niDEFENSE [\\\nreported](http://www.idefense.com/advisory/11.06.02.txt) about a vulnerability in LuxMan, a maze game for\nGNU/Linux, similar to the PacMan arcade game. When successfully\nexploited a local attacker gains read-write access to the memory,\nleading to a local root compromise in many ways, examples of which\ninclude scanning the file for fragments of the master password file\nand modifying kernel memory to re-map system calls.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 0.41-17.1 for the current stable\ndistribution (woody) and in version 0.41-19 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is not\naffected since it doesn't contain a luxman package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your luxman package immediately.\n\n\n",
