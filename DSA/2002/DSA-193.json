	"details": "\niDEFENSE [\\\nreports](http://www.idefense.com/advisory/11.11.02.txt) a security vulnerability in the klisa package, that\nprovides a LAN information service similar to \"Network Neighbourhood\",\nwhich was discovered by Texonet. It is possible for a local attacker\nto exploit a buffer overflow condition in resLISa, a restricted\nversion of KLISa. The vulnerability exists in the parsing of the\nLOGNAME environment variable, an overly long value will overwrite the\ninstruction pointer thereby allowing an attacker to seize control of\nthe executable.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 2.2.2-14.2 for the current stable\ndistribution (woody) and in version 2.2.2-14.3 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is not\naffected since it doesn't contain a kdenetwork package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your klisa package immediately.\n\n\n",
