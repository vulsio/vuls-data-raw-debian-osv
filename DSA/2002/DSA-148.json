	"summary": "hylafax - buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nA set of problems have been discovered in Hylafax, a flexible\nclient/server fax software distributed with many GNU/Linux\ndistributions. Quoting SecurityFocus the problems are in detail:\n\n\n* A format string vulnerability makes it possible for users to\n potentially execute arbitrary code on some implementations. Due to\n insufficient checking of input, it's possible to execute a format\n string attack. Since this only affects systems with the faxrm and\n faxalter programs installed setuid, Debian is not vulnerable.\n* A buffer overflow has been reported in Hylafax. A malicious fax\n transmission may include a long scan line that will overflow a\n memory buffer, corrupting adjacent memory. An exploit may result\n in a denial of service condition, or possibly the execution of\n arbitrary code with root privileges.\n* A format string vulnerability has been discovered in faxgetty.\n Incoming fax messages include a Transmitting Subscriber\n Identification (TSI) string, used to identify the sending fax\n machine. Hylafax uses this data as part of a format string without\n properly sanitizing the input. Malicious fax data may cause the\n server to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n* Marcin Dawcewicz discovered a format string vulnerability in hfaxd,\n which will crash hfaxd under certain circumstances. Since Debian\n doesn't have hfaxd installed setuid root, this problem cannot\n directly lead into a vulnerability. This has been fixed by Darren\n Nickerson, which was already present in newer versions, but not in\n the potato version.\n\n\nThese problems have been fixed in version 4.0.2-14.3 for the old\nstable distribution (potato), in version 4.1.1-1.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 4.1.2-2.1 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your hylafax packages.\n\n\n",
