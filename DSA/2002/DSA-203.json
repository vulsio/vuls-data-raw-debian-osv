	"details": "\nRobert Luberda found a security problem in smb2www, a Windows Network\nclient that is accessible through a web browser. This could lead a\nremote attacker to execute arbitrary programs under the user id\nwww-data on the host where smb2www is running.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 980804-16.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody), in version 980804-8.1 of the old stable\ndistribution (potato) and in version 980804-17 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your smb2www package immediately.\n\n\n",
