	"summary": "im - insecure temporary files",
	"details": "\nTatsuya Kinoshita discovered that IM, which contains interface\ncommands and Perl libraries for E-mail and NetNews, creates temporary\nfiles insecurely.\n\n\n* The impwagent program creates a temporary directory in an insecure\n manner in /tmp using predictable directory names without checking\n the return code of mkdir, so it's possible to seize a permission\n of the temporary directory by local access as another user.\n* The immknmz program creates a temporary file in an insecure manner\n in /tmp using a predictable filename, so an attacker with local\n access can easily create and overwrite files as another user.\n\n\nThese problems have been fixed in version 141-18.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody), in version 133-2.2 of the old stable\ndistribution (potato) and in version 141-20 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your IM package.\n\n\n",
