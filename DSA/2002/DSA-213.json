	"details": "\nGlenn Randers-Pehrson discovered a problem in connection with 16-bit\nsamples from libpng, an interface for reading and writing PNG\n(Portable Network Graphics) format files. The starting offsets for\nthe loops are calculated incorrectly which causes a buffer overrun\nbeyond the beginning of the row buffer.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.0.12-3.woody.3 for libpng and in version\n1.2.1-1.1.woody.3 for libpng3.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed\nin version 1.0.5-1.1 for libpng. There are no other libpng packages.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.12-7 for libpng and in version 1.2.5-8 for libpng3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.\n\n\n",
