	"details": "\nZack Weinberg discovered an insecure use of a temporary file in\nos.\\_execvpe from os.py. It uses a predictable name which could lead\nexecution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in several versions of Python: For the\ncurrent stable distribution (woody) it has been fixed in version\n1.5.2-23.1 of Python 1.5, in version 2.1.3-3.1 of Python 2.1 and in\nversion 2.2.1-4.1 of Python 2.2. For the old stable distribution\n(potato) this has been fixed in version 1.5.2-10potato12 for Python\n1.5. For the unstable distribution (sid) this has been fixed in\nversion 1.5.2-24 of Python 1.5, in version 2.1.3-6a of Python 2.1 and\nin version 2.2.1-8 of Python 2.2. Python 2.3 is not affected by this\nproblem.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Python packages immediately.\n\n\n",
