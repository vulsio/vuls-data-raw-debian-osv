	"details": "\nAll versions of the EPIC script Light prior to 2.7.30p5 (on the 2.7\nbranch) and prior to 2.8pre10 (on the 2.8 branch) running on any\nplatform are vulnerable to a remotely-exploitable bug, which can lead\nto nearly arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 2.7.30p5-1.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 2.7.30p5-2 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is not\naffected, since it doesn't contain the Light package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your epic4-script-light package and\nrestart your IRC client.\n\n\n",
