	"summary": "heartbeat - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nNathan Wallwork [\\\ndiscovered](http://linux-ha.org/security/sec01.txt) a buffer overflow in heartbeat, a subsystem\nfor High-Availability Linux. A remote attacker could send a specially\ncrafted UDP packet that overflows a buffer, leaving heartbeat to\nexecute arbitrary code as root.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 0.4.9.0l-7.2 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and version 0.4.9.2-1 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) doesn't\ncontain a heartbeat package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your heartbeat package immediately if\nyou run internet connected servers that are heartbeat-monitored.\n\n\n",
