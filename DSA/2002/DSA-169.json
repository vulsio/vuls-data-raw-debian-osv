This could lead into a cross site\nscripting attack if somebody has control over the server responses of\na remote web server which is crawled by ht://Check.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 1.1-1.1 for the current stable\ndistribution (woody) and in version 1.1-1.2 for the unstable release\n(sid). The old stable release (potato) does not contain the htcheck\npackage.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your htcheck package immediately.\n\n\n",
