	"summary": "gaim - arbitrary program execution",
	"details": "\nThe developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client that combines\nseveral different networks, found a vulnerability in the hyperlink\nhandling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an untrusted\nstring to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting, permitting\nan attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users machine.\nUnfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the user\nclicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't\nvulnerable.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 0.58-2.2 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 0.59.1-2 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is not\naffected since it doesn't ship the Gaim program.\n\n\nThe fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser\ncommand to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will\nneed to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual'\nbrowser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the\n'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from\nthe login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar\nin the buddy list window.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gaim package immediately.\n\n\n",
