	"summary": "scrollkeeper - insecure temporary file creation",
	"details": "\nSpybreak discovered a problem in scrollkeeper, a free electronic\ncataloging system for documentation. The scrollkeeper-get-cl program\ncreates temporary files in an insecure manner in /tmp using guessable\nfilenames. Since scrollkeeper is called automatically when a user\nlogs into a Gnome session, an attacker with local access can easily\ncreate and overwrite files as another user.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 0.3.6-3.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 0.3.11-2 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is not\naffected, since it doesn't contain the scrollkeeper package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your scrollkeeper packages immediately.\n\n\n",
