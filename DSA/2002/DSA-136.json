	"summary": "openssl - multiple remote exploits",
	"details": "\nThe OpenSSL development team has announced that a security audit by A.L.\nDigital Ltd and The Bunker, under the DARPA CHATS program, has revealed\nremotely exploitable buffer overflow conditions in the OpenSSL code.\nAdditionally, the ASN1 parser in OpenSSL has a potential DoS attack\nindependently discovered by Adi Stav and James Yonan.\n\n\nCAN-2002-0655 references overflows in buffers used to hold ASCII\nrepresentations of integers on 64 bit platforms. CAN-2002-0656\nreferences buffer overflows in the SSL2 server implementation (by\nsending an invalid key to the server) and the SSL3 client implementation\n(by sending a large session id to the client). The SSL2 issue was also\nnoticed by Neohapsis, who have privately demonstrated exploit code for\nthis issue. CAN-2002-0659 references the ASN1 parser DoS issue.\n\n\nThese vulnerabilities have been addressed for Debian 3.0 (woody) in\nopenssl094\\_0.9.4-6.woody.2, openssl095\\_0.9.5a-6.woody.1 and\nopenssl\\_0.9.6c-2.woody.1.\n\n\nThese vulnerabilities are also present in Debian 2.2 (potato). Fixed\npackages are available in openssl094\\_0.9.4-6.potato.2 and\nopenssl\\_0.9.6c-0.potato.4.\n\n\nA worm is actively exploiting this issue on internet-attached hosts;\nwe recommend you upgrade your OpenSSL as soon as possible. Note that you\nmust restart any daemons using SSL. (E.g., ssh or ssl-enabled apache.)\nIf you are uncertain which programs are using SSL you may choose to\nreboot to ensure that all running daemons are using the new libraries.\n\n\n",
