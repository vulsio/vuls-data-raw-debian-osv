	"summary": "ethereal - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nEthereal developers discovered a buffer overflow in the ISIS protocol\ndissector. It may be possible to make Ethereal crash or hang by\ninjecting a purposefully malformed packet onto the wire, or by\nconvincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file. It may be\npossible to make Ethereal run arbitrary code by exploiting the buffer\nand pointer problems.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 0.9.4-1woody2 for the current\nstable distribution (woody), in version 0.8.0-4potato.1 for\nthe old stable distribution (potato) and in version 0.9.6-1 for the\nunstable distribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.\n\n\n",
