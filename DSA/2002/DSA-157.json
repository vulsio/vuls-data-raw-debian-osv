	"details": "\nThe IRC client irssi is vulnerable to a denial of service condition.\nThe problem occurs when a user attempts to join a channel that has an\noverly long topic description. When a certain string is appended to\nthe topic, irssi will crash.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 0.8.4-3.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 0.8.5-2 for the\nunstable distribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is\nnot affected, since the corresponding portions of code are not\npresent. The same applies to irssi-gnome and irssi-gtk, which don't\nseem to be affected as well.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your irssi-text package.\n\n\n",
