This problem\nis triggered by scanning the PostScript file and can be exploited by\nan attacker sending a malformed PostScript or PDF file. The attacker\nis able to cause arbitrary code to be run with the privileges of the\nvictim.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 1.1.96-3.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody), in version 0.82-2.1 for the old stable\ndistribution (potato) and version 1.99.7-9 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnome-gv package.\n\n\n",
