	"summary": "courier - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nA problem in the Courier sqwebmail package, a CGI program to grant\nauthenticated access to local mailboxes, has been discovered. The\nprogram did not drop permissions fast enough upon startup under\ncertain circumstances so a local shell user can execute the sqwebmail\nbinary and manage to read an arbitrary file on the local filesystem.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 0.37.3-2.3 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 0.40.0-1 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) does not\ncontain Courier sqwebmail packages. `courier-ssl` packages\nare also not affected since they don't expose an sqwebmail package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sqwebmail package immediately.\n\n\n",
