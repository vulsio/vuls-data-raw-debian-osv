	"summary": "mysql - multiple problems",
	"details": "\nWhile performing an audit of MySQL e-matters found several problems:\n\n\n\nsigned/unsigned problem in COM\\_TABLE\\_DUMP\n \n Two sizes were taken as signed integers from a request and then cast\n to unsigned integers without checking for negative numbers. Since the\n resulting numbers where used for a memcpy() operation this could lead\n to memory corruption.\nPassword length handling in COM\\_CHANGE\\_USER\n \n When re-authenticating to a different user MySQL did not perform\n all checks that are performed on initial authentication. This created\n two problems:\n * it allowed for single-character password brute forcing (as was fixed in\n February 2000 for initial login) which could be used by a normal user to\n gain root privileges to the database\n* it was possible to overflow the password buffer and force the server\n to execute arbitrary code\n\nread\\_rows() overflow in libmysqlclient\n \n When processing the rows returned by a SQL server there was no check\n for overly large rows or terminating NUL characters. This can be used\n to exploit SQL clients if they connect to a compromised MySQL server.\nread\\_one\\_row() overflow in libmysqlclient\n \n When processing a row as returned by a SQL server the returned field\n sizes were not verified. This can be used to exploit SQL clients if they\n connect to a compromised MySQL server.\n\nFor Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody this has been fixed in version 3.23.49-8.2\nand version 3.22.32-6.3 for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2/potato.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages as soon as possible.\n\n\n",
