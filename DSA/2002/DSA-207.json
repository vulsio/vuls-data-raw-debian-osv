	"summary": "tetex-bin - arbitrary command execution",
	"details": "\nThe SuSE security team discovered a vulnerability in kpathsea library\n(libkpathsea) which is used by xdvi and dvips. Both programs call the\nsystem() function insecurely, which allows a remote attacker to\nexecute arbitrary commands via cleverly crafted DVI files.\n\n\nIf dvips is used in a print filter, this allows a local or remote\nattacker with print permission execute arbitrary code as the printer\nuser (usually lp).\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 1.0.7+20011202-7.1 for the\ncurrent stable distribution (woody), in version 1.0.6-7.3 for the old\nstable distribution (potato) and in version 1.0.7+20021025-4 for the\nunstable distribution (sid). xdvik-ja and dvipsk-ja are vulnerable as\nwell, but link to the kpathsea library dynamically and will\nautomatically be fixed after a new libkpathsea is installed.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tetex-lib package immediately.\n\n\n",
