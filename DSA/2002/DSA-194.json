	"summary": "masqmail - buffer overflows",
	"details": "\nA set of buffer overflows have been discovered in masqmail, a mail\ntransport agent for hosts without permanent internet connection. In\naddition to this privileges were dropped only after reading a user\nsupplied configuration file. Together this could be exploited to gain\nunauthorized root access to the machine on which masqmail is\ninstalled.\n\n\nThese problems have been fixed in version 0.1.16-2.1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 0.2.15-1 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is not\naffected since it doesn't contain a masqmail package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your masqmail package immediately.\n\n\n",
