	"details": "\nA security vulnerability has been found in all Tomcat 4.x releases.\nThis problem allows an attacker to use a specially crafted URL to\nreturn the unprocessed source code of a JSP page, or, under special\ncircumstances, a static resource which would otherwise have been\nprotected by security constraints, without the need for being properly\nauthenticated.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 4.0.3-3woody1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 4.1.12-1 for the unstable\nrelease (sid). The old stable release (potato) does not contain\ntomcat packages. Also, packages for tomcat3 are not vulnerable to\nthis problem.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat package immediately.\n\n\n",
