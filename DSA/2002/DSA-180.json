	"details": "\nThorsten Kukuck discovered a problem in the ypserv program which is\npart of the Network Information Services (NIS). A memory leak in all\nversions of ypserv prior to 2.5 is remotely exploitable. When a\nmalicious user could request a non-existing map the server will leak\nparts of an old domainname and mapname.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 3.9-6.1 for the current stable\ndistribution (woody), in version 3.8-2.1 for the old stable\ndistribution (potato) and in version 3.9-6.2 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nis package.\n\n\n",
