	"summary": "wmaker - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nAl Viro found a problem in the image handling code use in Window Maker,\na popular NEXTSTEP like window manager. When creating an image it would\nallocate a buffer by multiplying the image width and height, but did not\ncheck for an overflow. This makes it possible to overflow the buffer.\nThis could be exploited by using specially crafted image files (for\nexample when previewing themes).\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 0.80.0-4.1 for the current stable\ndistribution (woody). Packages for the mipsel architecture are not yet\navailable.\n\n\n",
