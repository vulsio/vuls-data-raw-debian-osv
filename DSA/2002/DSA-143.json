	"details": "\nAn integer overflow bug has been discovered in the RPC library used by\nthe Kerberos 5 administration system, which is derived from the SunRPC\nlibrary. This bug could be exploited to gain unauthorized root access\nto a KDC host. It is believed that the attacker needs to be able to\nauthenticate to the kadmin daemon for this attack to be successful.\nNo exploits are known to exist yet.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 1.2.4-5woody1 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 1.2.5-2 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). Debian 2.2 (potato) is not affected since it\ndoesn't contain krb5 packages.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kerberos packages immediately.\n\n\n",
