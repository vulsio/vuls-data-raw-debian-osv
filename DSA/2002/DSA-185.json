	"details": "\nA stack buffer overflow in the kadm\\_ser\\_wrap\\_in function in the\nKerberos v4 administration server was discovered, which is provided by\nHeimdal as well. A working exploit for this kadmind bug is already\ncirculating, hence it is considered serious. The broken library also\ncontains a vulnerability which could lead to another root exploit.\n\n\nThese problems have been fixed in version 0.4e-7.woody.5 for the\ncurrent stable distribution (woody), in version 0.2l-7.6 for the old\nstable distribution (potato) and in version 0.4e-22 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages immediately.\n\n\n",
