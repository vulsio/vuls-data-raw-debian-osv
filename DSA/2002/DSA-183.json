	"details": "\nTom Yu and Sam Hartman of MIT discovered another stack buffer overflow\nin the kadm\\_ser\\_wrap\\_in function in the Kerberos v4 administration\nserver. This kadmind bug has a working exploit code circulating,\nhence it is considered serious. The MIT krb5 implementation\nincludes support for version 4, including a complete v4 library,\nserver side support for krb4, and limited client support for v4.\n\n\nThis problem has been fixed in version 1.2.4-5woody3 for the current\nstable distribution (woody) and in version 1.2.6-2 for the unstable\ndistribution (sid). The old stable distribution (potato) is not\naffected since no krb5 packages are included.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages immediately.\n\n\n",
