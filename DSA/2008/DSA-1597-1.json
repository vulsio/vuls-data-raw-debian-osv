The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following three\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-5824](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5824)\nInsufficient validation and bounds checking of the Authorization:\n HTTP header enables a heap buffer overflow, potentially enabling\n the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-5825](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5825)\nFormat string vulnerabilities in debug logging within the\n authentication of XML-RPC requests could enable the execution of\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2008-1771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1771)\nAn integer overflow weakness in the handling of HTTP POST\n variables could allow a heap buffer overflow and potentially\n arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.2.4+r1376-1.1+etch2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.9~r1696-1.4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mt-daapd package.\n\n\n",
