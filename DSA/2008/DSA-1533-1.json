The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identified the following three problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-6354](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6354)\nInadequate EXIF property validation could lead to invalid memory\n accesses if executed on a maliciously crafted image, potentially\n including heap corruption and the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-6355](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6355)\nFlawed data validation could lead to integer overflows, causing\n other invalid memory accesses, also with the potential for memory\n corruption or arbitrary code execution.\n* [CVE-2007-6356](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6356)\nCyclical EXIF image file directory (IFD) references could cause\n a denial of service (infinite loop).\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.98-1.1+0sarge1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.98-1.1+etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.01-0.1.\n\n\n",
