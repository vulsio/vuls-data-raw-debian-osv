	"summary": "horde3 - missing input sanitising",
	"details": "\nUlf HÃ¤rnhammar discovered that the HTML filter of the Horde web\napplication framework performed insufficient input sanitising, which\nmay lead to the deletion of emails if a user is tricked into viewing\na malformed email inside the Imp client.\n\n\nThis update also provides backported bugfixes to the cross-site \nscripting filter and the user management API from the latest Horde\nrelease 3.1.6.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected. An update to\nEtch is recommended, though.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.1.3-4etch2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your horde3 package.\n\n\n",
