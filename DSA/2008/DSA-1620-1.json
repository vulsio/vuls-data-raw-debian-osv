	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the\nPython language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-2052](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2052)\nPiotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale\n module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may\n result in a minor information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2007-4965](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4965)\nIt was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop\n module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is\n tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also\n tracked as [CVE-2008-1679](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1679) due to an initially incomplete patch.\n* [CVE-2008-1721](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1721)\nJustin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib\n module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2008-1887](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1887)\nJustin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in\n PyString\\_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary\n code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.5-5+etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.5.2-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python2.5 packages.\n\n\n",
