	"summary": "postfix - privilege escalation",
	"details": "\nSebastian Krahmer discovered that Postfix, a mail transfer agent,\nincorrectly checks the ownership of a mailbox. In some configurations,\nthis allows for appending data to arbitrary files as root.\n\n\nNote that only specific configurations are vulnerable; the default\nDebian installation is not affected. Only a configuration meeting\nthe following requirements is vulnerable:\n\n\n* The mail delivery style is mailbox, with the Postfix built-in\n local(8) or virtual(8) delivery agents.\n* The mail spool directory (/var/spool/mail) is user-writeable.\n* The user can create hardlinks pointing to root-owned symlinks\n located in other directories.\n\n\nFor a detailed treating of the issue, please refer to the upstream\n[author's announcement](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.mail.postfix.announce/110).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.8-2+etch1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.5.2-2lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed\nin version 2.5.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your postfix package.\n\n\n",
