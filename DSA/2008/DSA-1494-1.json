	"details": "\nThe vmsplice system call did not properly verify address arguments\npassed by user space processes, which allowed local attackers to\noverwrite arbitrary kernel memory, gaining root privileges\n([CVE-2008-0010](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0010),\n[CVE-2008-0600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0600)).\n\n\nIn the vserver-enabled kernels, a missing access check on certain\nsymlinks in /proc enabled local attackers to access resources in other\nvservers ([CVE-2008-0163](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0163)).\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version\n2.6.18.dfsg.1-18etch1.\n\n\nIn addition to these fixes, this update also incorporates changes from the\nupcoming point release of the stable distribution.\n\n\nSome architecture builds were not yet available at the time of DSA-1494-1.\nThis update to DSA-1494 provides linux-2.6 packages for these remaining\narchitectures, as well as additional binary packages that are built\nfrom source code provided by linux-2.6.\n\n\nThe unstable (sid) and testing (lenny) distributions will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and\nuser-mode-linux packages.\n\n\n",
