	"summary": "kernel-source-2.4.27 - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux\nkernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary\ncode. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2004-2731](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2731)\ninfamous41md reported multiple integer overflows in the Sbus PROM\n driver that would allow for a DoS (Denial of Service) attack by a\n local user, and possibly the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2006-4814](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4814)\nDoug Chapman discovered a potential local DoS (deadlock) in the mincore\n function caused by improper lock handling.\n* [CVE-2006-5753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5753)\nEric Sandeen provided a fix for a local memory corruption vulnerability\n resulting from a misinterpretation of return values when operating on\n inodes which have been marked bad.\n* [CVE-2006-5823](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5823)\nLMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious\n user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted cramfs filesystem.\n* [CVE-2006-6053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6053)\nLMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious\n user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext3 filesystem.\n* [CVE-2006-6054](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6054)\nLMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious\n user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext2 filesystem.\n* [CVE-2006-6106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6106)\nMarcel Holtman discovered multiple buffer overflows in the Bluetooth\n subsystem which can be used to trigger a remote DoS (crash) and potentially\n execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2007-1353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1353)\nIlja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the\n Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This\n could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel\n memory.\n* [CVE-2007-1592](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1592)\nMasayuki Nakagawa discovered that flow labels were inadvertently\n being shared between listening sockets and child sockets. This defect\n can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (Oops).\n* [CVE-2007-2172](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2172)\nThomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could\n be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,\n potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).\n A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed\n in a subsequent update.\n* [CVE-2007-2525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2525)\nFlorian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused\n by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could\n be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.\n* [CVE-2007-3848](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3848)\nWojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath\\_signal was not being reset\n properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain\n privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.\n* [CVE-2007-4308](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4308)\nAlan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged\n local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin\n privileges.\n* [CVE-2007-4311](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4311)\nPaX team discovered an issue in the random driver where a defect in the\n reseeding code leads to a reduction in entropy.\n* [CVE-2007-5093](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5093)\nAlex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam\n devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it\n open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting\n in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as\n it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system\n or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their\n behalf.\n* [CVE-2007-6063](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6063)\nVenustech AD-LAB discovered a a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl\n handling, exploitable by a local user.\n* [CVE-2007-6151](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6151)\nADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that\n may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory by issuing\n ioctls with unterminated data.\n* [CVE-2007-6206](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6206)\nBlake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user\n exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file\n retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to\n gain access to sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2007-6694](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6694)\nCyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific\n to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue\n to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).\n* [CVE-2008-0007](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0007)\nNick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which\n register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be\n exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly\n execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 3.1 (sarge) |\n| --- | --- |\n| alsa-modules-i386 | 1.0.8+2sarge2 |\n| kernel-image-2.4.27-arm | 2.4.27-2sarge6 |\n| kernel-image-2.4.27-m68k | 2.4.27-3sarge6 |\n| kernel-image-speakup-i386 | 2.4.27-1.1sarge5 |\n| kernel-image-2.4.27-alpha | 2.4.27-10sarge6 |\n| kernel-image-2.4.27-s390 | 2.4.27-2sarge6 |\n| kernel-image-2.4.27-sparc | 2.4.27-9sarge6 |\n| kernel-image-2.4.27-i386 | 2.4.27-10sarge6 |\n| kernel-image-2.4.27-ia64 | 2.4.27-10sarge6 |\n| kernel-patch-2.4.27-mips | 2.4.27-10.sarge4.040815-3 |\n| kernel-patch-powerpc-2.4.27 | 2.4.27-10sarge6 |\n| kernel-latest-2.4-alpha | 101sarge3 |\n| kernel-latest-2.4-i386 | 101sarge2 |\n| kernel-latest-2.4-s390 | 2.4.27-1sarge2 |\n| kernel-latest-2.4-sparc | 42sarge3 |\n| i2c | 1:2.9.1-1sarge2 |\n| lm-sensors | 1:2.9.1-1sarge4 |\n| mindi-kernel | 2.4.27-2sarge5 |\n| pcmcia-modules-2.4.27-i386 | 3.2.5+2sarge2 |\n| hostap-modules-i386 | 1:0.3.7-1sarge3 |\n| systemimager | 3.2.3-6sarge5 |\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot\nthe machine.
