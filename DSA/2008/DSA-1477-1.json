	"details": "\nDuncan Gilmore discovered that yarssr, an RSS aggregator and reader,\nperforms insufficient input sanitising, which could result in the\nexecution of arbitrary shell commands if a malformed feed is read.\n\n\nDue to a technical limitation of the archive management scripts, the\nfix for the old stable distribution (sarge) needs to be postponed\nby a few days.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.2.2-1etch1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your yarssr packages.\n\n\n",
