	"summary": "clamav - denial of service",
	"details": "\nDamian Put discovered a vulnerability in the ClamAV anti-virus\ntoolkit's parsing of Petite-packed Win32 executables. The weakness\nleads to an invalid memory access, and could enable an attacker to\ncrash clamav by supplying a maliciously crafted Petite-compressed\nbinary for scanning. In some configurations, such as when clamav\nis used in combination with mail servers, this could cause a system\nto fail open, facilitating a follow-on viral attack.\n\n\nA previous version of this advisory referenced packages that were\nbuilt incorrectly and omitted the intended correction. This\nissue was fixed in packages referenced by the -2 revision of the\nadvisory.\n\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this\nweakness as [CVE-2008-2713](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2713)\nand [CVE-2008-3215](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3215).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.90.1dfsg-3.1+etch14.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.93.1.dfsg-1.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.\n\n\n",
