The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-6454](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6454)\nLuigi Auriemma discovered that PeerCast is vulnerable to a heap\n overflow in the HTTP server code, which allows remote attackers to\n cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a\n long SOURCE request.\n* [CVE-2008-2040](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2040)\nNico Golde discovered that PeerCast, a P2P audio and video streaming\n server, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the HTTP Basic\n Authentication code, allowing a remote attacker to crash PeerCast or\n execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.5.4-1.1etch0.\n\n\ngnome-peercast has been removed from the unstable distribution (sid).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnome-peercast package.\n\n\n",
