	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for\nthe Ruby language, which may lead to denial of service and other\nsecurity problems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-3655](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3655)\nKeita Yamaguchi discovered that several safe level restrictions\n are insufficiently enforced.\n* [CVE-2008-3656](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3656)\nChristian Neukirchen discovered that the WebRick module uses\n inefficient algorithms for HTTP header splitting, resulting in\n denial of service through resource exhaustion.\n* [CVE-2008-3657](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3657)\nIt was discovered that the dl module doesn't perform taintness\n checks.\n* [CVE-2008-3790](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3790)\nLuka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek discovered that recursively nested\n XML entities can lead to denial of service through resource\n exhaustion in rexml.\n* [CVE-2008-3905](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3905)\nTanaka Akira discovered that the resolv module uses sequential\n transaction IDs and a fixed source port for DNS queries, which\n makes it more vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.0+20060609-1etch3. Packages for arm will be provided later.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.0.2-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9 packages.\n\n\n",
