	"summary": "mysql-dfsg-5.0 - authorization bypass",
	"details": "\nSergei Golubchik discovered that MySQL, a widely-deployed database\nserver, did not properly validate optional data or index directory\npaths given in a CREATE TABLE statement, nor would it (under proper\nconditions) prevent two databases from using the same paths for data\nor index files. This permits an authenticated user with authorization\nto create tables in one database to read, write or delete data from\ntables subsequently created in other databases, regardless of other\nGRANT authorizations. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies this weakness as [CVE-2008-2079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2079).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.0.32-7etch6. Note that the fix applied will have the\nconsequence of disallowing the selection of data or index paths\nunder the database root, which on a Debian system is /var/lib/mysql;\ndatabase administrators needing to control the placement of these\nfiles under that location must do so through other means.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.\n\n\n",
