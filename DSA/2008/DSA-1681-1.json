	"summary": "linux-2.6.24 - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-3528](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3528)\nEugene Teo reported a local DoS issue in the ext2 and ext3\n filesystems. Local users who have been granted the privileges\n necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted\n filesystem that causes the kernel to output error messages in an\n infinite loop.\n* [CVE-2008-4554](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4554)\nMilos Szeredi reported that the usage of splice() on files opened\n with O\\_APPEND allows users to write to the file at arbitrary\n offsets, enabling a bypass of possible assumed semantics of the\n O\\_APPEND flag.\n* [CVE-2008-4576](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4576)\nVlad Yasevich reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that may\n allow remote users to cause a local DoS by triggering a kernel\n oops.\n* [CVE-2008-4618](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4618)\nWei Yongjun reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that may allow\n remote users to cause a local DoS by triggering a kernel panic.\n* [CVE-2008-4933](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4933)\nEric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus\n filesystem. Local users who have been granted the privileges\n necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted\n filesystem that causes the kernel to overrun a buffer, resulting\n in a system oops or memory corruption.\n* [CVE-2008-4934](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4934)\nEric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus\n filesystem. Local users who have been granted the privileges\n necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted\n filesystem that results in a kernel oops due to an unchecked\n return value.\n* [CVE-2008-5025](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5025)\nEric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfs filesystem.\n Local users who have been granted the privileges necessary to\n mount a filesystem would be able to craft a filesystem with a\n corrupted catalog name length, resulting in a system oops or\n memory corruption.\n* [CVE-2008-5029](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5029)\nAndrea Bittau reported a DoS issue in the unix socket subsystem\n that allows a local user to cause memory corruption, resulting in\n a kernel panic.\n* [CVE-2008-5134](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5134)\nJohannes Berg reported a remote DoS issue in the libertas wireless\n driver, which can be triggered by a specially crafted beacon/probe\n response.\n* [CVE-2008-5182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5182)\nAl Viro reported race conditions in the inotify subsystem that may\n allow local users to acquire elevated privileges.\n* [CVE-2008-5300](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5300)\nDann Frazier reported a DoS condition that allows local users to\n cause the out of memory handler to kill off privileged processes\n or trigger soft lockups due to a starvation issue in the unix\n socket subsystem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.\n\n\n",
