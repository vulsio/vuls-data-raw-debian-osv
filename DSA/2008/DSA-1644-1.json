These flaws could allow an attacker to cause a denial\nof service (a crash) or potentially execution of arbitrary code by\nsupplying a maliciously crafted video file.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0~rc1-12etch5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0~rc2-18.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mplayer packages.\n\n\n",
