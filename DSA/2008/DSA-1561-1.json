	"details": "\nChristian Herzog discovered that within the Linux Terminal Server Project,\nit was possible to connect to X on any LTSP client from any host on the\nnetwork, making client windows and keystrokes visible to that host.\n\n\nNOTE: most ldm installs are likely to be in a chroot environment exported\nover NFS, and will not be upgraded merely by upgrading the server itself.\nFor example, on the i386 architecture, to upgrade ldm will likely require:\n\n\n\n```\n    chroot /opt/ltsp/i386 apt-get update\n    chroot /opt/ltsp/i386 apt-get dist-upgrade\n```\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.99debian11+etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:0.1~bzr20080308-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ldm package.\n\n\n",
