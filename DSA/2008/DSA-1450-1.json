This could potentially allow a local\nuser to gain additional privileges.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.12p-4sarge2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version\n2.12r-19etch1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your util-linux package.\n\n\n",
