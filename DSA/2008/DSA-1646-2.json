	"details": "\nA weakness has been discovered in squid, a caching proxy server. The\nflaw was introduced upstream in response to [CVE-2007-6239](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6239), and\nannounced by Debian in [DSA-1482-1](dsa-1482). The flaw involves an\nover-aggressive bounds check on an array resize, and could be\nexploited by an authorized client to induce a denial of service\ncondition against squid.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6.5-6etch2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.\n\n\n",
