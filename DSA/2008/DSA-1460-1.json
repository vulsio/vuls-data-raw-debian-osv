	"details": "\n\nSeveral local vulnerabilities have been discovered in PostgreSQL, an\nobject-relational SQL database. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-3278](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3278)\n\n It was discovered that the DBLink module performed insufficient\n credential validation. This issue is also tracked as [CVE-2007-6601](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6601),\n since the initial upstream fix was incomplete.\n* [CVE-2007-4769](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4769)\n\n Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that a bug in the handling\n of back-references inside the regular expressions engine could lead\n to an out of bounds read, resulting in a crash. This constitutes only\n a security problem if an application using PostgreSQL processes\n regular expressions from untrusted sources.\n* [CVE-2007-4772](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4772)\n\n Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that the optimizer for regular\n expression could be tricked into an infinite loop, resulting in denial\n of service. This constitutes only a security problem if an application\n using PostgreSQL processes regular expressions from untrusted sources.\n* [CVE-2007-6067](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6067)\n\n Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that the optimizer for regular\n expression could be tricked massive resource consumption. This\n constitutes only a security problem if an application using PostgreSQL\n processes regular expressions from untrusted sources.\n* [CVE-2007-6600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6600)\n\n Functions in index expressions could lead to privilege escalation. For\n a more in depth explanation please see the upstream announce available\n at <http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.905>.\n\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge), doesn't contain postgresql-8.1.\n\n\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version\npostgresql-8.1 8.1.11-0etch1.\n\n\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 8.2.6-1 of postgresql-8.2.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.1 (8.1.11-0etch1) package.\n\n\n\n",
