	"details": "\nSeveral local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd,\na fast webserver with minimal memory footprint.\n\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the \nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-0983](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0983)\nlighttpd 1.4.18, and possibly other versions before 1.5.0, does not\n properly calculate the size of a file descriptor array, which allows \n remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large number \n of connections, which triggers an out-of-bounds access.\n* [CVE-2007-3948](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3948)\nconnections.c in lighttpd before 1.4.16 might accept more connections \n than the configured maximum, which allows remote attackers to cause a\n denial of service (failed assertion) via a large number of connection\n attempts.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.13-4etch9.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.18-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd package.\n\n\n",
