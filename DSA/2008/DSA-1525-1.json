	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Asterisk, a free\nsoftware PBX and telephony toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-6430](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6430)\nTilghman Lesher discovered that database-based registrations are\n insufficiently validated. This only affects setups, which are\n configured to run without a password and only host-based\n authentication.\n* [CVE-2008-1332](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1332)\nJason Parker discovered that insufficient validation of From:\n headers inside the SIP channel driver may lead to authentication\n bypass and the potential external initiation of calls.\n* [CVE-2008-1333](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1333)\nThis update also fixes a format string vulnerability, which can only be\n triggered through configuration files under control of the local\n administrator. In later releases of Asterisk this issue is remotely\n exploitable and tracked as [CVE-2008-1333](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1333).\n\n\nThe status of the old stable distribution (sarge) is currently being\ninvestigated. If affected, an update will be released through\nsecurity.debian.org.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:1.2.13~dfsg-2etch3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.\n\n\n",
