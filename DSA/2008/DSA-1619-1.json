	"summary": "python-dns - DNS response spoofing",
	"details": "\nMultiple weaknesses have been identified in PyDNS, a DNS client\nimplementation for the Python language. Dan Kaminsky identified a\npractical vector of DNS response spoofing and cache poisoning,\nexploiting the limited entropy in a DNS transaction ID and lack of\nUDP source port randomization in many DNS implementations. Scott\nKitterman noted that python-dns is vulnerable to this predictability,\nas it randomizes neither its transaction ID nor its source port.\nTaken together, this lack of entropy leaves applications using\npython-dns to perform DNS queries highly susceptible to response\nforgery.\n\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this\nclass of weakness as [CVE-2008-1447](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1447)\nand this specific instance in PyDNS as [CVE-2008-4099](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4099).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.3.0-5.2+etch1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-dns package.\n\n\n",
