The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\nIt was discovered that several buffer overflows can be triggered via a\nlong folder extension argument to the tmail or dmail program. This\ncould lead to arbitrary code execution ([CVE-2008-5005](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5005)).\n\n\nIt was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered by\na malicious response to the QUIT command leading to a denial of service\n([CVE-2008-5006](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5006)).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2002edebian1-13.1+etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution\n(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 2007d~dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your uw-imap packages.\n\n\n",
