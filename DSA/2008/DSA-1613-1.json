	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been identified in libgd2, a library\nfor programmatic graphics creation and manipulation. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-2445](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2445)\nGrayscale PNG files containing invalid tRNS chunk CRC values\n could cause a denial of service (crash), if a maliciously\n crafted image is loaded into an application using libgd.\n* [CVE-2007-3476](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3476)\nAn array indexing error in libgd's GIF handling could induce a\n denial of service (crash with heap corruption) if exceptionally\n large color index values are supplied in a maliciously crafted\n GIF image file.\n* [CVE-2007-3477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3477)\nThe imagearc() and imagefilledarc() routines in libgd allow\n an attacker in control of the parameters used to specify\n the degrees of arc for those drawing functions to perform\n a denial of service attack (excessive CPU consumption).\n* [CVE-2007-3996](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3996)\nMultiple integer overflows exist in libgd's image resizing and\n creation routines; these weaknesses allow an attacker in control\n of the parameters passed to those routines to induce a crash or\n execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\n an application or interpreter linked against libgd2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.33-5.2etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these\nproblems have been fixed in version 2.0.35.dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.\n\n\n",
