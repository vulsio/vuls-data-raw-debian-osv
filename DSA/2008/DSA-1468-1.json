	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat\nservlet and JSP engine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-0128](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0128)\nOlaf Kock discovered that HTTPS encryption was insufficiently\n enforced for single-sign-on cookies, which could result in\n information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2007-2450](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2450)\nIt was discovered that the Manager and Host Manager web applications\n performed insufficient input sanitising, which could lead to cross site\n scripting.\n\n\nThis update also adapts the tomcat5.5-webapps package to the tightened\nJULI permissions introduced in the previous tomcat5.5 DSA. However, it\nshould be noted, that the tomcat5.5-webapps is for demonstration and\ndocumentation purposes only and should not be used for production\nsystems.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tomcat5.5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.5.20-2etch2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat5.5 packages.\n\n\n",
