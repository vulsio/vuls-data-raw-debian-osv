	"summary": "iceweasel - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel\nweb browser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-0412](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0412)\nJesse Ruderman, Kai Engert, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren and Paul\n Nickerson discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might allow\n the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2008-0413](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0413)\nCarsten Book, Wesley Garland, Igor Bukanov, moz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4, shutdown,\n Philip Taylor and tgirmann discovered crashes in the JavaScript\n engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2008-0414](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0414)\nhong and Gregory Fleischer discovered that file input focus\n vulnerabilities in the file upload control could allow information\n disclosure of local files.\n* [CVE-2008-0415](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0415)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 and Boris Zbarsky discovered several\n vulnerabilities in JavaScript handling, which could allow\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2008-0417](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0417)\nJustin Dolske discovered that the password storage mechanism could\n be abused by malicious web sites to corrupt existing saved passwords.\n* [CVE-2008-0418](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0418)\nGerry Eisenhaur and moz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered that a directory\n traversal vulnerability in chrome: URI handling could lead to\n information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2008-0419](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0419)\nDavid Bloom discovered a race condition in the image handling of\n designMode elements, which can lead to information disclosure and\n potentially the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2008-0591](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0591)\nMichal Zalewski discovered that timers protecting security-sensitive\n dialogs (by disabling dialog elements until a timeout is reached)\n could be bypassed by window focus changes through JavaScript.\n* [CVE-2008-0592](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0592)\nIt was discovered that malformed content declarations of saved\n attachments could prevent a user from opening local files\n with a .txt file name, resulting in minor denial of service.\n* [CVE-2008-0593](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0593)\nMartin Straka discovered that insecure stylesheet handling during\n redirects could lead to information disclosure.\n* [CVE-2008-0594](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0594)\nEmil Ljungdahl and Lars-Olof Moilanen discovered that phishing\n protections could be bypassed with <div> elements.\n\n\nThe Mozilla products from the old stable distribution (sarge) are no\nlonger supported with security updates.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.0.12-0etch1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.\n\n\n",
