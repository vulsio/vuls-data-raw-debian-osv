	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a denial of service, privilege escalation or a leak of\nsensitive data. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-1514](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1514)\nJan Kratochvil reported a local denial of service vulnerability in\n the ptrace interface for the s390 architecture. Local users can\n trigger an invalid pointer dereference, leading to a system panic.\n* [CVE-2008-3525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3525)\nEugene Teo reported a lack of capability checks in the kernel\n driver for Granch SBNI12 leased line adapters (sbni), allowing\n local users to perform privileged operations.\n* [CVE-2008-3831](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3831)\nOlaf Kirch discovered an issue with the i915 driver that may allow\n local users to cause memory corruption by use of an ioctl with\n insufficient privilege restrictions.\n* [CVE-2008-4113](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4113)/[CVE-2008-4445](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4445)\nEugene Teo discovered two issues in the SCTP subsystem which allow\n local users to obtain access to sensitive memory when the\n SCTP-AUTH extension is enabled.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.\n\n\n",
