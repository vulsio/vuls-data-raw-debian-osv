	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xine-lib, a library\nwhich supplies most of the application functionality of the xine\nmultimedia player. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following three problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-1482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1482)\nInteger overflow vulnerabilities exist in xine's FLV, QuickTime,\n RealMedia, MVE and CAK demuxers, as well as the EBML parser used\n by the Matroska demuxer. These weaknesses allow an attacker to\n overflow heap buffers and potentially execute arbitrary code by\n supplying a maliciously crafted file of those types.\n* [CVE-2008-1686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1686)\nInsufficient input validation in the Speex implementation used\n by this version of xine enables an invalid array access and the\n execution of arbitrary code by supplying a maliciously crafted\n Speex file.\n* [CVE-2008-1878](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1878)\nInadequate bounds checking in the NES Sound Format (NSF) demuxer\n enables a stack buffer overflow and the execution of arbitrary\n code through a maliciously crafted NSF file.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1.2+dfsg-7.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.1.12-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib packages.\n\n\n",
