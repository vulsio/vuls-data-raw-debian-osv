	"details": "\nPaul Szabo rediscovered a vulnerability in the File::Path::rmtree\nfunction of Perl. It was possible to exploit a race condition to create\nsetuid binaries in a directory tree or remove arbitrary files when a\nprocess is deleting this tree. This issue was originally known as\n[CVE-2005-0448](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0448) and [CVE-2004-0452](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-0452), which were addressed by DSA-696-1 and\nDSA-620-1. Unfortunately, they were reintroduced later.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.8.8-7etch5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in \nversion 5.10.0-18 and will migrate to the testing distribution (lenny) \nshortly.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.\n\n\n",
