	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in NET SNMP, a suite of\nSimple Network Management Protocol applications. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-0960](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0960)\nWes Hardaker reported that the SNMPv3 HMAC verification relies on\n the client to specify the HMAC length, which allows spoofing of\n authenticated SNMPv3 packets.\n* [CVE-2008-2292](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2292)\nJohn Kortink reported a buffer overflow in the \\_\\_snprint\\_value\n function in snmp\\_get causing a denial of service and potentially\n allowing the execution of arbitrary code via a large OCTETSTRING \n in an attribute value pair (AVP).\n* [CVE-2008-4309](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4309)\nIt was reported that an integer overflow in the\n netsnmp\\_create\\_subtree\\_cache function in agent/snmp\\_agent.c allows \n remote attackers to cause a denial of service attack via a crafted \n SNMP GETBULK request.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems has been fixed in\nversion 5.2.3-7etch4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid)\nthese problems have been fixed in version 5.4.1~dfsg-11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your net-snmp package.\n\n\n",
