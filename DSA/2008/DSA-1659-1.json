	"details": "\nDan Kaminsky discovered that libspf2, an implementation of the Sender\nPolicy Framework (SPF) used by mail servers for mail filtering, handles\nmalformed TXT records incorrectly, leading to a buffer overflow\ncondition ([CVE-2008-2469](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2469)).\n\n\nNote that the SPF configuration template in Debian's Exim configuration\nrecommends to use libmail-spf-query-perl, which does not suffer from\nthis issue.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.5-4+etch1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.5.dfsg-5+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libspf2 package.\n\n\n",
