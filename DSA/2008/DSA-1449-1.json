	"details": "\nIt was discovered that loop-aes-utils, tools for mounting and manipulating\nfilesystems, didn't drop privileged user and group permissions in the correct order\nin the mount and umount commands. This could potentially allow a local\nuser to gain additional privileges.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.12p-4sarge2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version\n2.12r-15+etch1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your loop-aes-utils package.\n\n\n",
