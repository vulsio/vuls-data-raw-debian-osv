The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-0016](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0016)\nJustin Schuh, Tom Cross and Peter Williams discovered a buffer\n overflow in the parser for UTF-8 URLs, which may lead to the\n execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2008-3835](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3835)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered that the same-origin check in\n nsXMLDocument::OnChannelRedirect() could by bypassed.\n* [CVE-2008-3836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3836)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered that several vulnerabilities in\n feedWriter could lead to Chrome privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2008-3837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3837)\nPaul Nickerson discovered that an attacker could move windows\n during a mouse click, resulting in unwanted action triggered by\n drag-and-drop.\n* [CVE-2008-4058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4058)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered a vulnerability which can result in\n Chrome privilege escalation through XPCNativeWrappers.\n* [CVE-2008-4059](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4059)\nmoz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered a vulnerability which can result in\n Chrome privilege escalation through XPCNativeWrappers.\n* [CVE-2008-4060](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4060)\nOlli Pettay and moz\\_bug\\_r\\_a4 discovered a Chrome privilege\n escalation vulnerability in XSLT handling.\n* [CVE-2008-4061](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4061)\nJesse Ruderman discovered a crash in the layout engine, which might\n allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2008-4062](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4062)\nIgor Bukanov, Philip Taylor, Georgi Guninski and Antoine Labour\n discovered crashes in the Javascript engine, which might allow the\n execution of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2008-4065](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4065)\nDave Reed discovered that some Unicode byte order marks are\n stripped from Javascript code before execution, which can result in\n code being executed, which were otherwise part of a quoted string.\n* [CVE-2008-4066](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4066)\nGareth Heyes discovered that some Unicode surrogate characters are\n ignored by the HTML parser.\n* [CVE-2008-4067](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4067)\nBoris Zbarsky discovered that resource: URLs allow directory\n traversal when using URL-encoded slashes.\n* [CVE-2008-4068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4068)\nGeorgi Guninski discovered that resource: URLs could bypass local\n access restrictions.\n* [CVE-2008-4069](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4069)\nBilly Hoffman discovered that the XBM decoder could reveal\n uninitialised memory.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.0.17-0etch1. Packages for hppa will be provided later.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.0.3 of iceweasel and 1.9.0.3-1 of xulrunner.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.\n\n\n",
