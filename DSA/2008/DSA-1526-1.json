	"details": "\nSteve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered several local\nvulnerabilities in xwine, a graphical user interface for the WINE emulator.\n\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-0930](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0930)\nThe xwine command makes unsafe use of local temporary files when\n printing. This could allow the removal of arbitrary files belonging\n to users who invoke the program.\n* [CVE-2008-0931](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0931)\nThe xwine command changes the permissions of the global WINE configuration\n file such that it is world-writable. This could allow local users to edit\n it such that arbitrary commands could be executed whenever any local user\n executed a program under WINE.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version\n1.0.1-1etch1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xwine package.\n\n\n",
