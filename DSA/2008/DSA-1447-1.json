The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-3382](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3382)\n\n It was discovered that single quotes (') in cookies were treated\n as a delimiter, which could lead to an information leak.\n* [CVE-2007-3385](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3385)\n\n It was discovered that the character sequence \\\" in cookies was\n handled incorrectly, which could lead to an information leak.\n* [CVE-2007-3386](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3386)\n\n It was discovered that the host manager servlet performed\n insufficient input validation, which could lead to a cross-site\n scripting attack.\n* [CVE-2007-5342](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5342)\n\n It was discovered that the JULI logging component did not restrict\n its target path, resulting in potential denial of service through\n file overwrites.\n* [CVE-2007-5461](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5461)\n\n It was discovered that the WebDAV servlet is vulnerable to absolute\n path traversal.\n\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tomcat5.5.\n\n\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.5.20-2etch1.\n\n\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat5.5 packages.\n\n\n\n",
