The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-5316](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5316)\nInadequate enforcement of fixed-length buffer limits allows an\n attacker to overflow a buffer on the stack, potentially enabling\n the execution of arbitrary code when a maliciously-crafted\n image is opened.\n* [CVS-2008-5317](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVS-2008-5317)\nAn integer sign error in reading image gamma data could allow an\n attacker to cause an under-sized buffer to be allocated for\n subsequent image data, with unknown consequences potentially\n including the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted\n image is opened.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.15-1.1+etch1.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (lenny), and the unstable\ndistribution (sid), these problems are fixed in version 1.17.dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your lcms packages.\n\n\n",
