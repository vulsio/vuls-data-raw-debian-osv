	"details": "\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in libnet-dns-perl.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\nIt was discovered that libnet-dns-perl generates very weak transaction\nIDs when sending queries ([CVE-2007-3377](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3377)). This update switches\ntransaction ID generation to the Perl random generator, making\nprediction attacks more difficult.\n\n\nCompression loops in domain names resulted in an infinite loop in the\ndomain name expander written in Perl ([CVE-2007-3409](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3409)). The Debian\npackage uses an expander written in C by default, but this vulnerability\nhas been addressed nevertheless.\n\n\nDecoding malformed A records could lead to a crash (via an uncaught\nPerl exception) of certain applications using libnet-dns-perl\n([CVE-2007-6341](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6341)).\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.48-1sarge1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.59-1etch1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libnet-dns-perl package.\n\n\n",
