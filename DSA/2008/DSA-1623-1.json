	"summary": "dnsmasq - cache poisoning",
	"details": "\nDan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol\nlead to practical DNS cache poisoning attacks. Among other things,\nsuccessful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic and email\nrerouting.\n\n\nThis update changes Debian's dnsmasq packages to implement the\nrecommended countermeasure: UDP query source port randomization. This\nchange increases the size of the space from which an attacker has to\nguess values in a backwards-compatible fashion and makes successful\nattacks significantly more difficult.\n\n\nThis update also switches the random number generator to Dan\nBernstein's SURF.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.35-1+etch4. Packages for alpha will be provided later.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.43-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq package.\n\n\n",
