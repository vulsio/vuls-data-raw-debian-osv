The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following two problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2007-4542](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4542)\nLack of input sanitizing and output escaping in the CGI\n mapserver's template handling and error reporting routines leads\n to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2007-4629](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4629)\nMissing bounds checking in mapserver's template handling leads to\n a stack-based buffer overrun vulnerability, allowing a remote\n attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the CGI\n or httpd user.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.10.0-5.1+etch2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.10.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mapserver (4.10.0-5.1+etch2) package.\n\n\n",
