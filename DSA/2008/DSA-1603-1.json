	"summary": "bind9 - cache poisoning",
	"details": "\nDan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol\nlead to practical DNS cache poisoning attacks. Among other things,\nsuccessful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic and email\nrerouting.\n\n\nThis update changes Debian's BIND 9 packages to implement the\nrecommended countermeasure: UDP query source port randomization. This\nchange increases the size of the space from which an attacker has to\nguess values in a backwards-compatible fashion and makes successful\nattacks significantly more difficult.\n\n\nNote that this security update changes BIND network behavior in a\nfundamental way, and the following steps are recommended to ensure a\nsmooth upgrade.\n\n\n1. Make sure that your network configuration is compatible with source\nport randomization. If you guard your resolver with a stateless packet\nfilter, you may need to make sure that no non-DNS services listen on\nthe 1024--65535 UDP port range and open it at the packet filter. For\ninstance, packet filters based on etch's Linux 2.6.18 kernel only\nsupport stateless filtering of IPv6 packets, and therefore pose this\nadditional difficulty. (If you use IPv4 with iptables and ESTABLISHED\nrules, networking changes are likely not required.)\n\n\n2. Install the BIND 9 upgrade, using \"apt-get update\" followed by\n\"apt-get install bind9\". Verify that the named process has been\nrestarted and answers recursive queries. (If all queries result in\ntimeouts, this indicates that networking changes are necessary; see the\nfirst step.)\n\n\n3. Verify that source port randomization is active. Check that the\n/var/log/daemon.log file does not contain messages of the following\nform\n\n\n\n```\nnamed[6106]: /etc/bind/named.conf.options:28: using specific query-source port suppresses port randomization and can be insecure.\n```\n\nright after the \"listening on IPv6 interface\" and \"listening on IPv4\ninterface\" messages logged by BIND upon startup. If these messages are\npresent, you should remove the indicated lines from the configuration,\nor replace the port numbers contained within them with \"\\*\" sign (e.g.,\nreplace \"port 53\" with \"port \\*\").\n\n\nFor additional certainty, use tcpdump or some other network monitoring\ntool to check for varying UDP source ports. If there is a NAT device\nin front of your resolver, make sure that it does not defeat the\neffect of source port randomization.\n\n\n4. If you cannot activate source port randomization, consider\nconfiguring BIND 9 to forward queries to a resolver which can, possibly\nover a VPN such as OpenVPN to create the necessary trusted network link.\n(Use BIND's forward-only mode in this case.)\n\n\nOther caching resolvers distributed by Debian (PowerDNS, MaraDNS,\nUnbound) already employ source port randomization, and no updated\npackages are needed. BIND 9.5 up to and including version\n1:9.5.0.dfsg-4 only implements a weak form of source port\nrandomization and needs to be updated as well. For information on\nBIND 8, see [DSA-1604-1](dsa-1604), and for the status of\nthe libc stub resolver, see [DSA-1605-1](dsa-1605).\n\n\nThe updated bind9 packages contain changes originally scheduled for\nthe next stable point release, including the changed IP address of\nL.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (Debian bug #[449148](https://bugs.debian.org/449148)).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 9.3.4-2etch3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 package.\n\n\n",
