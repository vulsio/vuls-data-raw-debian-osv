	"details": "\nA symlink traversal vulnerability was discovered in MySQL, a\nrelational database server. The weakness could permit an attacker\nhaving both CREATE TABLE access to a database and the ability to\nexecute shell commands on the database server to bypass MySQL access\ncontrols, enabling them to write to tables in databases to which they\nwould not ordinarily have access.\n\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this\nvulnerability as [CVE-2008-4098](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4098). Note that a closely aligned issue,\nidentified as [CVE-2008-4097](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4097), was prevented by the update announced in\nDSA-1608-1. This new update supersedes that fix and mitigates both\npotential attack vectors.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.0.32-7etch8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.\n\n\n",
