	"summary": "linux-2.6.24 - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may\nlead to a denial of service or leak sensitive data. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2008-3272](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3272)\nTobias Klein reported a locally exploitable data leak in the\n snd\\_seq\\_oss\\_synth\\_make\\_info() function. This may allow local users\n to gain access to sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2008-3275](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3275)\nZoltan Sogor discovered a coding error in the VFS that allows local users\n to exploit a kernel memory leak resulting in a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2008-3276](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3276)\nEugene Teo reported an integer overflow in the DCCP subsystem that\n may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service in the form\n of a kernel panic.\n* [CVE-2008-3526](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3526)\nEugene Teo reported a missing bounds check in the SCTP subsystem.\n By exploiting an integer overflow in the SCTP\\_AUTH\\_KEY handling code,\n remote attackers may be able to cause a denial of service in the form\n of a kernel panic.\n* [CVE-2008-3534](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3534)\nKel Modderman reported an issue in the tmpfs filesystem that allows\n local users to crash a system by triggering a kernel BUG() assertion.\n* [CVE-2008-3535](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3535)\nAlexey Dobriyan discovered an off-by-one-error in the iov\\_iter\\_advance\n function which can be exploited by local users to crash a system,\n resulting in a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2008-3792](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3792)\nVlad Yasevich reported several NULL pointer reference conditions in\n the SCTP subsystem that can be triggered by entering sctp-auth codepaths\n when the AUTH feature is inactive. This may allow attackers to cause\n a denial of service condition via a system panic.\n* [CVE-2008-3915](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3915)\nJohann Dahm and David Richter reported an issue in the nfsd subsystem\n that may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a\n buffer overflow.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.\n\n\n",
