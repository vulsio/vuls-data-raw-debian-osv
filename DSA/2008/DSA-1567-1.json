	"details": "\nStefan Cornelius discovered a vulnerability in the Radiance High\nDynamic Range (HDR) image parser in Blender, a 3D modelling\napplication. The weakness could enable a stack-based buffer overflow\nand the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted HDR file\nis opened, or if a directory containing such a file is browsed via\nBlender's image-open dialog.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.42a-7.1+etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.45-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your blender packages.\n\n\n",
