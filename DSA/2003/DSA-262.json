	"details": "\nSebastian Krahmer of the SuSE security audit team found two problems\nin samba, a popular SMB/CIFS implementation. The problems are:\n\n\n* a buffer overflow in the SMB/CIFS packet fragment re-assembly code\n used by smbd. Since smbd runs as root an attacker can use this to\n gain root access to a machine running smbd.\n* the code to write reg files was vulnerable for a chown race which made\n it possible for a local user to overwrite system files\n\n\nBoth problems have been fixed in upstream version 2.2.8, and version\n2.2.3a-12.1 of package for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody.\n\n\n",
