	"details": "\nThe developers of tomcat discovered several problems in tomcat version\n3.x. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0042](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0042): A maliciously crafted request could return a\n directory listing even when an index.html, index.jsp, or other\n welcome file is present. File contents can be returned as well.\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0043](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0043): A malicious web application could read the contents\n of some files outside the web application via its web.xml file in\n spite of the presence of a security manager. The content of files\n that can be read as part of an XML document would be accessible.\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0044](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0044): A cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered\n in the included sample web application that allows remote attackers\n to execute arbitrary script code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.3a-4woody.1.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not contain tomcat packages.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.3.1a-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat package.\n\n\n",
