	"summary": "kernel-image-2.4.18-1-alpha, kernel-image-2.4.18-1-i386, kernel-source-2.4.18 - local root exploit",
	"details": "\nRecently multiple servers of the Debian project were compromised using a\nDebian developers account and an unknown root exploit. Forensics\nrevealed a burneye encrypted exploit. Robert van der Meulen managed to\ndecrypt the binary which revealed a kernel exploit. Study of the exploit\nby the Red Hat and SuSE kernel and security teams quickly revealed that\nthe exploit used an integer overflow in the brk system call. Using\nthis bug it is possible for a userland program to trick the kernel into\ngiving access to the full kernel address space. This problem was found\nin September by Andrew Morton, but unfortunately that was too late for\nthe 2.4.22 kernel release.\n\n\nThis bug has been fixed in kernel version 2.4.23 for the 2.4 tree and\n2.6.0-test6 kernel tree. For Debian it has been fixed in version\n2.4.18-14 of the kernel source packages, version 2.4.18-12 of the i386\nkernel images and version 2.4.18-11 of the alpha kernel images.\n\n\n",
