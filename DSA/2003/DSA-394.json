	"summary": "openssl095 - ASN.1 parsing vulnerability",
	"details": "\nSteve Henson of the OpenSSL core team identified and prepared fixes\nfor a number of vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL ASN1 code that were\ndiscovered after running a test suite by British National\nInfrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC).\n\n\nA bug in OpenSSLs SSL/TLS protocol was also identified which causes\nOpenSSL to parse a client certificate from an SSL/TLS client when it\nshould reject it as a protocol error.\n\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CAN-2003-0543](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0543):\n\nInteger overflow in OpenSSL that allows remote attackers to cause a\n denial of service (crash) via an SSL client certificate with\n certain ASN.1 tag values.\n\n* [CAN-2003-0544](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0544):\n\nOpenSSL does not properly track the number of characters in certain\n ASN.1 inputs, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n service (crash) via an SSL client certificate that causes OpenSSL\n to read past the end of a buffer when the long form is used.\n\n* [CAN-2003-0545](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0545):\n\nDouble-free vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial\n of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an SSL\n client certificate with a certain invalid ASN.1 encoding. This bug\n was only present in OpenSSL 0.9.7 and is listed here only for\n reference.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in openssl095 version 0.9.5a-6.woody.3.\n\n\nThis package is not present in the unstable (sid) or testing (sarge)\ndistribution.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libssl095a packages and restart\nservices using this library. Debian doesn't ship any packages that\nare linked against this library.\n\n\nThe following commandline (courtesy of Ray Dassen) produces a list of\nnames of running processes that have libssl095 mapped into their\nmemory space:\n\n\n\n```\n\n    find /proc -name maps -exec egrep -l 'libssl095' {} /dev/null \\; \\\n    | sed -e 's/[^0-9]//g' | xargs --no-run-if-empty ps --no-headers -p | \\\n    sed -e 's/^\\+//' -e 's/ \\+/ /g' | cut -d ' ' -f 5 | sort | uniq\n\n```\n\nYou should restart the associated services.\n\n\n",
