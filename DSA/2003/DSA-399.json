	"summary": "epic4 - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nJeremy Nelson discovered a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in\nEPIC4, a popular client for Internet Relay Chat (IRC). A malicious\nserver could craft a reply which triggers the client to allocate a\nnegative amount of memory. This could lead to a denial of service if\nthe client only crashes, but may also lead to executing of arbitrary\ncode under the user id of the chatting user.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.2.20020219-2.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.11.20030409-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your epic4 package.\n\n\n",
