	"details": "\nSteve Kemp discovered that osh, a shell intended to restrict the\nactions of the user, contains two buffer overflows, in processing\nenvironment variables and file redirections. These vulnerabilities\ncould be used to execute arbitrary code, overriding any restrictions\nplaced on the shell.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.7-11woody1.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) is affected by this problem, and\nmay be fixed in a future advisory on a time-available basis.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem is fixed in version\n1.7-12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your osh package.\n\n\n",
