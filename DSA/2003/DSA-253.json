	"details": "\nA vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer\n(SSL) implementation. In an upcoming paper, Brice Canvel (EPFL),\nAlain Hiltgen (UBS), Serge Vaudenay (EPFL), and Martin Vuagnoux (EPFL,\nIlion) describe and demonstrate a timing-based attack on CBC cipher\nsuites used in SSL and TLS. OpenSSL has been found to be vulnerable to\nthis attack.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 0.9.6c-2.woody.2.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed\nin version 0.9.6c-0.potato.5. Please note that this updates the\nversion from potato-proposed-updates that supersedes the version in\npotato.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.7a-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\n",
