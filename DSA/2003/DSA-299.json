This\nprogram was not designed to run setuid, and contained multiple\nvulnerabilities which could be exploited to gain root privileges.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2-3.1.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a leksbot\npackage.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your leksbot package.\n\n\n",
