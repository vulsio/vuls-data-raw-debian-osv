	"details": "\nViliam Holub discovered a bug in gtksee whereby, when loading PNG\nimages of certain color depths, gtksee would overflow a heap-allocated\nbuffer. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker using a\ncarefully constructed PNG image to execute arbitrary code when the\nvictim loads the file in gtksee.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.5.0-6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\nRefer to [Debian bug #76346](https://bugs.debian.org/76346).\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your gtksee package.\n\n\n",
