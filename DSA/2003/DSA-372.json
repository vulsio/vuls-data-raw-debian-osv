	"summary": "netris - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nShaun Colley discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in netris, a\nnetwork version of a popular puzzle game. A netris client connecting\nto an untrusted netris server could be sent an unusually long data\npacket, which would be copied into a fixed-length buffer without\nbounds checking. This vulnerability could be exploited to gain the\nprivileges of the user running netris in client mode, if they connect\nto a hostile netris server.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed\nin version 0.5-4woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem is fixed in version\n0.52-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your netris package.\n\n\n",
