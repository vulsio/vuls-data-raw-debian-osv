	"summary": "xaos - improper setuid-root execution",
	"details": "\nXaoS, a program for displaying fractal images, is installed setuid\nroot on certain architectures in order to use svgalib, which requires\naccess to the video hardware. However, it is not designed for secure\nsetuid execution, and can be exploited to gain root privileges.\n\n\nIn these updated packages, the setuid bit has been removed from the\nxaos binary. Users who require the svgalib functionality should grant\nthese privileges only to a trusted group.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is exploitable in version 3.0-18 (potato) on i386\nand alpha architectures, and in version 3.0-23 (woody) on the i386\narchitecture only.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.0-23woody1.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed\nin version 3.0-18potato1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.1r-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your xaos package.\n\n\n",
