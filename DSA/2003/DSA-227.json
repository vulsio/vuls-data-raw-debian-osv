In addition to these bugs, various local\nexploitable bugs within the OpenLDAP2 libraries have been fixed.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been\nfixed in version 2.0.23-6.3.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not contain OpenLDAP2\npackages.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.27-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openldap2 packages.\n\n\n",
