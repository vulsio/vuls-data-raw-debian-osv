	"details": "\nCAN-2003-0073: The mysql package contains a bug whereby dynamically\nallocated memory is freed more than once, which could be deliberately\ntriggered by an attacker to cause a crash, resulting in a denial of\nservice condition. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a valid\nusername and password combination for access to the MySQL server is\nrequired.\n\n\nCAN-2003-0150: The mysql package contains a bug whereby a malicious\nuser, granted certain permissions within mysql, could create a\nconfiguration file which would cause the mysql server to run as root,\nor any other user, rather than the mysql user.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) both problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.23.49-8.4.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) is only affected by\nCAN-2003-0150, and this has been fixed in version 3.22.32-6.4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), CAN-2003-0073 was fixed in\nversion 4.0.12-2, and CAN-2003-0150 will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your mysql package.\n\n\n",
