Since sendmail also parses headers\nwhen forwarding emails this vulnerability can hit mail-servers which do\nnot deliver the email as well.\n\n\nThis has been fixed in upstream release 8.12.8, version 8.12.3-5 of\nthe package for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody and version 8.9.3-25 of the\npackage for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2/potato.\n\n\nDSA-257-2: Updated sendmail-wide packages are available in package\nversion 8.9.3+3.2W-24 for Debian 2.2 (potato) and\nversion 8.12.3+3.5Wbeta-5.2 for Debian 3.0 (woody).\n\n\n",
