	"details": "\nThe kernel module loader in Linux 2.2 and Linux 2.4 kernels has a flaw\nin ptrace. This hole allows local users to obtain root privileges by\nusing ptrace to attach to a child process that is spawned by the\nkernel. Remote exploitation of this hole is not possible.\n\n\nThis advisory only covers kernel packages for the S/390 architecture.\nOther architectures will be covered by separate advisories.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in the\nfollowing versions:\n\n\n* kernel-patch-2.4.17-s390: version 0.0.20020816-0.woody.1.1\n* kernel-image-2.4.17-s390: version 2.4.17-2.woody.2.2\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by this problem\nfor this architecture since s390 was first released with Debian\nGNU/Linux 3.0 (woody).\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kernel-images packages immediately.\n\n\n",
