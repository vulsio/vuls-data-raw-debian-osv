	"summary": "cvs - doubly freed memory",
	"details": "\nStefan Esser [\\\ndiscovered](http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012003.html) a problem in cvs, a concurrent versions\nsystem, which is used for many Free Software projects. The current\nversion contains a flaw that can be used by a remote attacker to\nexecute arbitrary code on the CVS server under the user id the CVS\nserver runs as. Anonymous read-only access is sufficient to exploit\nthis problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.11.1p1debian-8.1.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed\nin version 1.10.7-9.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cvs package immediately.\n\n\n",
