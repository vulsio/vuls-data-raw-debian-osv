	"details": "\nByrial Jensen discovered a couple of off-by-one buffer overflow in the\nIMAP code of Mutt, a text-oriented mail reader supporting IMAP, MIME,\nGPG, PGP and threading. This problem could potentially allow a remote\nmalicious IMAP server to cause a denial of service (crash) and\npossibly execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted mail folder.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.28-2.2.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) is also affected by this problem\nand an update will follow.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.0 and above.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mutt package.\n\n\n",
