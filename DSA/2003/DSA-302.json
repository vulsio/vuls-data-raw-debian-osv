	"summary": "fuzz - privilege escalation",
	"details": "\nJoey Hess discovered that fuzz, a software stress-testing tool,\ncreates a temporary file without taking appropriate security\nprecautions. This bug could allow an attacker to gain the privileges\nof the user invoking fuzz, excluding root (fuzz does not allow itself\nto be invoked as root).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.6-6woody1.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a fuzz package.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your fuzz package.\n\n\n",
