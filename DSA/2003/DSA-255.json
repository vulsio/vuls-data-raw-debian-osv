	"summary": "tcpdump - infinite loop",
	"details": "\nAndrew Griffiths and iDEFENSE Labs discovered a problem in tcpdump, a\npowerful tool for network monitoring and data acquisition. An\nattacker is able to send a specially crafted network packet which\ncauses tcpdump to enter an infinite loop.\n\n\nIn addition to the above problem the tcpdump developers discovered a\npotential infinite loop when parsing malformed BGP packets. They also\ndiscovered a buffer overflow that can be exploited with certain\nmalformed NFS packets.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been\nfixed in version 3.6.2-2.3.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not seem to be affected\nby these problems.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.7.1-1.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump packages.\n\n\n",
