	"summary": "lv - privilege escalation",
	"details": "\nLeonard Stiles discovered that lv, a multilingual file viewer, would\nread options from a configuration file in the current directory.\nBecause such a file could be placed there by a malicious user, and lv\nconfiguration options can be used to execute commands, this\nrepresented a security vulnerability. An attacker could gain the\nprivileges of the user invoking lv, including root.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.49.4-7woody2.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed\nin version 4.49.3-4potato2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem is fixed in version\n4.49.5-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your lv package.\n\n\n",
