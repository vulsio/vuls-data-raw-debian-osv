	"summary": "krb5 - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in krb5, an\nimplementation of MIT Kerberos.\n\n\n* A cryptographic weakness in version 4 of the Kerberos protocol\n allows an attacker to use a chosen-plaintext attack to impersonate\n any principal in a realm. Additional cryptographic weaknesses in\n the krb4 implementation included in the MIT krb5 distribution\n permit the use of cut-and-paste attacks to fabricate krb4 tickets\n for unauthorized client principals if triple-DES keys are used to\n key krb4 services. These attacks can subvert a site's entire\n Kerberos authentication infrastructure.\n\n Kerberos version 5 does not contain this cryptographic\n vulnerability. Sites are not vulnerable if they have Kerberos v4\n completely disabled, including the disabling of any krb5 to krb4\n translation services.\n* The MIT Kerberos 5 implementation includes an RPC library derived\n from SUNRPC. The implementation contains length checks, that are\n vulnerable to an integer overflow, which may be exploitable to\n create denials of service or to gain unauthorized access to\n sensitive information.\n* Buffer overrun and underrun problems exist in Kerberos principal\n name handling in unusual cases, such as names with zero components,\n names with one empty component, or host-based service principal\n names with no host name component.\n\n\n\nThis version of the krb5 package changes the default behavior and\ndisallows cross-realm authentication for Kerberos version 4. Because\nof the fundamental nature of the problem, cross-realm authentication\nin Kerberos version 4 cannot be made secure and sites should avoid its\nuse. A new option (-X) is provided to the krb5kdc and krb524d\ncommands to re-enable version 4 cross-realm authentication for those\nsites that must use this functionality but desire the other security\nfixes.\n\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.2.4-5woody4.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not contain krb5 packages.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 package.\n\n\n",
