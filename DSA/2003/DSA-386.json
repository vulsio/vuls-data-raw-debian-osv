	"details": "\nThe SuSE security team discovered during an audit a bug in\nMail::Mailer, a Perl module used for sending email, whereby\npotentially untrusted input is passed to a program such as mailx,\nwhich may interpret certain escape sequences as commands to be\nexecuted.\n\n\nThis bug has been fixed by removing support for programs such as mailx\nas a transport for sending mail. Instead, alternative mechanisms are\nused.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.44-1woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your libmailtools-perl package.\n\n\n",
