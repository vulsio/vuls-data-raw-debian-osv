	"details": "\nNOTE: due to a combination of administrative problems, this advisory\nwas erroneously released with the identifier \"DSA-338-1\". DSA-338-1\ncorrectly refers to an earlier advisory regarding proftpd.\n\n\nx-face-el, a decoder for images included inline in X-Face email\nheaders, does not take appropriate security precautions when creating\ntemporary files. This bug could potentially be exploited to overwrite\narbitrary files with the privileges of the user running Emacs and\nx-face-el, potentially with contents supplied by the attacker.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.6.19-1woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.3.6.23-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your x-face-el package.\n\n\n",
