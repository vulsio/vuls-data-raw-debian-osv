	"details": "\nByrial Jensen discovered a couple of off-by-one buffer overflow in the\nIMAP code of Mutt, a text-oriented mail reader supporting IMAP, MIME,\nGPG, PGP and threading. This code is imported in the Balsa package.\nThis problem could potentially allow a remote malicious IMAP server to\ncause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code\nvia a specially crafted mail folder.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.4-2.2.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not seem to be affected by\nthis problem.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your balsa package.\n\n\n",
