	"details": "\nA cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in\nsquirrelmail, a feature-rich webmail package written in PHP4.\nSquirrelmail doesn't sanitize user provided variables in all places,\nleaving it vulnerable to a cross site scripting attack.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.2.6-1.3. The old stable distribution (potato) is\nnot affected since it doesn't contain a squirrelmail package.\n\n\nAn updated package for the unstable distribution (sid) is\nexpected soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.\n\n\n",
