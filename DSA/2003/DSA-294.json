	"summary": "gkrellm-newsticker - missing quoting, incomplete parser",
	"details": "\nBrian Campbell discovered two security-related problems in\ngkrellm-newsticker, a plugin for the gkrellm system monitor program,\nwhich provides a news ticker from RDF feeds. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n\n[CAN-2003-0205](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0205)\n\n It can launch a web browser of the user's choice when the ticker\n title is clicked by using the URI given by the feed. However,\n special shell characters are not properly escaped enabling a\n malicious feed to execute arbitrary shell commands on the clients\n machine.\n[CAN-2003-0206](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0206)\n\n It crashes the entire gkrellm system on feeds where link or title\n elements are not entirely on a single line. A malicious server\n could therefore craft a denial of service.\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.3-3.1.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) is not affected since it doesn't\ncontain gkrellm-newsticker packages.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems is not yet fixed.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gkrellm-newsticker package.\n\n\n",
