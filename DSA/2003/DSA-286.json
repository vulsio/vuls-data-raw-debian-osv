	"summary": "gs-common - insecure temporary file",
	"details": "\nPaul Szabo discovered insecure creation of a temporary file in\nps2epsi, a script that is distributed as part of gs-common which\ncontains common files for different Ghostscript releases. ps2epsi uses\na temporary file in the process of invoking ghostscript. This file\nwas created in an insecure fashion, which could allow a local attacker\nto overwrite files owned by a user who invokes ps2epsi.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.3.3.0woody1.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.3.3.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gs-common package.\n\n\n",
