	"details": "\nDan Jacobson noticed a problem in noffle, an offline news server, that\nleads to a segmentation fault. It is not yet clear whether this\nproblem is exploitable. However, if it is, a remote attacker could\ntrigger arbitrary code execution under the user that calls noffle,\nprobably news.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.1-1.1.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a noffle\npackage.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your noffle package.\n\n\n",
