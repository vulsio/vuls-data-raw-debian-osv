	"summary": "krb4 - Cryptographic weakness",
	"details": "\nA cryptographic weakness in version 4 of the Kerberos protocol allows\nan attacker to use a chosen-plaintext attack to impersonate any\nprincipal in a realm. Additional cryptographic weaknesses in the krb4\nimplementation permit the use of cut-and-paste attacks to fabricate\nkrb4 tickets for unauthorized client principals if triple-DES keys are\nused to key krb4 services. These attacks can subvert a site's entire\nKerberos authentication infrastructure.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.1-8-2.3.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.0-2.3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.2.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb4 packages immediately.\n\n\n",
