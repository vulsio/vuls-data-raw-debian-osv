	"summary": "libpam-smb - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nlibpam-smb is a PAM authentication module which makes it possible to\nauthenticate users against a password database managed by Samba or a\nMicrosoft Windows server. If a long password is supplied, this can\ncause a buffer overflow which could be exploited to execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the process which invokes PAM services.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.6-1.1woody1.\n\n\nThe unstable distribution (sid) does not contain a libpam-smb\npackage.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your libpam-smb package.\n\n\n",
