	"summary": "imp - SQL injection",
	"details": "\nJouko Pynnonen discovered a problem with IMP, a web based IMAP mail\nprogram. Using carefully crafted URLs a remote attacker is able to\ninject SQL code into SQL queries without proper user authentication.\nEven though results of SQL queries aren't directly readable from the\nscreen, an attacker might update their mail signature to contain wanted\nquery results and then view it on the preferences page of IMP.\n\n\nThe impact of SQL injection depends heavily on the underlying database\nand its configuration. If PostgreSQL is used, it's possible to\nexecute multiple complete SQL queries separated by semicolons. The\ndatabase contains session id's so the attacker might hijack sessions\nof people currently logged in and read their mail. In the worst case,\nif the hordemgr user has the required privilege to use the COPY SQL\ncommand (found in PostgreSQL at least), a remote user may read or\nwrite to any file the database user (postgres) can. The attacker may\nthen be able to run arbitrary shell commands by writing them to the\npostgres user's ~/.psqlrc; they'd be run when the user starts the psql\ncommand which under some configurations happens regularly from a cron\nscript.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 2.2.6-5.1.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been\nfixed in version 2.2.6-0.potato.5.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.6-7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your IMP packages.\n\n\n",
