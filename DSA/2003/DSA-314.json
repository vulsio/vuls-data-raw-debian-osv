An attacker could exploit\nthis bug remotely to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.6.1.1.0woody1.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not contain an atftp\npackage.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your atftp package.\n\n\n",
