	"summary": "linux-kernel-2.4.18 - several vulnerabilities",
	"details": "\nA number of vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel.\n\n\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0461](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0461): /proc/tty/driver/serial in Linux 2.4.x reveals the\n exact number of characters used in serial links, which could allow\n local users to obtain potentially sensitive information such as the\n length of passwords. This bug has been fixed by restricting access\n to /proc/tty/driver/serial.\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0462](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0462): A race condition in the way env\\_start and env\\_end\n pointers are initialized in the execve system call and used in\n fs/proc/base.c on Linux 2.4 allows local users to cause a denial of\n service (crash).\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0476](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0476): The execve system call in Linux 2.4.x records the\n file descriptor of the executable process in the file table of the\n calling process, which allows local users to gain read access to\n restricted file descriptors.\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0501](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0501): The /proc filesystem in Linux allows local users to\n obtain sensitive information by opening various entries in\n /proc/self before executing a setuid program, which causes the\n program to fail to change the ownership and permissions of those\n entries.\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0550](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0550): The STP protocol, as enabled in Linux 2.4.x, does not\n provide sufficient security by design, which allows attackers to\n modify the bridge topology. This bug has been fixed by disabling\n STP by default.\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0551](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0551): The STP protocol, as enabled in Linux 2.4.x, does not\n provide sufficient security by design, which allows attackers to\n modify the bridge topology.\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0552](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0552): Linux 2.4.x allows remote attackers to spoof the\n bridge forwarding table via forged packets whose source addresses\n are the same as the target.\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0018](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0018): Linux kernel 2.4.10 through 2.4.21-pre4 does not\n properly handle the O\\_DIRECT feature, which allows local attackers\n with write privileges to read portions of previously deleted files,\n or cause file system corruption. This bug has been fixed by\n disabling O\\_DIRECT.\n* [\\\n CAN-2003-0619](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0619): Integer signedness error in the decode\\_fh function of\n nfs3xdr.c in Linux kernel before 2.4.21 allows remote attackers to\n cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via a negative size value\n within XDR data of an NFSv3 procedure call.\n\n\nThis advisory covers only the i386 and alpha architectures. Other\narchitectures will be covered by separate advisories.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) on the i386 architecture, these\nproblems have been fixed in kernel-source-2.4.18 version 2.4.18-13,\nkernel-image-2.4.18-1-i386 version 2.4.18-11, and\nkernel-image-2.4.18-i386bf version 2.4.18-5woody4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) on the alpha architecture, these\nproblems have been fixed in kernel-source-2.4.18 version 2.4.18-13 and\nkernel-image-2.4.18-1-alpha version 2.4.18-10.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems are fixed in\nkernel-source-2.4.20 version 2.4.20-9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your kernel packages.\n\n\nIf you are using the kernel installed by the installation system when\nthe \"bf24\" option is selected (for a 2.4.x kernel), you should install\nthe kernel-image-2.4.18-bf2.4 package. If you installed a different\nkernel-image package after installation, you should install the\ncorresponding 2.4.18-1 kernel. You may use the table below as a\nguide.\n\n\n\n```\n\n   | If \"uname -r\" shows: | Install this package:\n   | 2.4.18-bf2.4         | kernel-image-2.4.18-bf2.4\n   | 2.4.18-386           | kernel-image-2.4.18-1-386\n   | 2.4.18-586tsc        | kernel-image-2.4.18-1-586tsc\n   | 2.4.18-686           | kernel-image-2.4.18-1-686\n   | 2.4.18-686-smp       | kernel-image-2.4.18-1-686-smp\n   | 2.4.18-k6            | kernel-image-2.4.18-1-k6\n   | 2.4.18-k7            | kernel-image-2.4.18-1-k7\n\n```\n\nNOTE: This kernel is binary compatible with the previous kernel\nsecurity update, but not binary compatible with the corresponding\nkernel included in Debian 3.0r1. If you have not already applied the\nprevious security update (kernel-image-2.4.18-bf2.4 version\n2.4.18-5woody1 or any of the 2.4.18-1-\\* kernels), then any custom\nmodules will need to be rebuilt in order to work with the new kernel.\nNew PCMCIA modules are provided for all of the above kernels.\n\n\nNOTE: A system reboot will be required immediately after the upgrade\nin order to replace the running kernel. Remember to read carefully\nand follow the instructions given during the kernel upgrade process.\n\n\n",
