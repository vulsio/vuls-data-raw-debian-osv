Paths are not properly\nsanitized, so a carefully crafted URL lead geneweb to read and display\narbitrary files of the system it runs on.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 4.06-2.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) is not affected.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been\nfixed in version 4.09-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your geneweb package.\n\n\n",
