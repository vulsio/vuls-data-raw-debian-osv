	"summary": "dhcp3 - stack overflows",
	"details": "\nThe Internet Software Consortium discovered several vulnerabilities\nduring an audit of the ISC DHCP Daemon. The vulnerabilities exist in\nerror handling routines within the minires library and may be\nexploitable as stack overflows. This could allow a remote attacker to\nexecute arbitrary code under the user id the dhcpd runs under, usually\nroot. Other DHCP servers than dhcp3 doesn't seem to be affected.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 3.0+3.0.1rc9-2.1.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not contain dhcp3 packages.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.0+3.0.1rc11-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dhcp3-server package.\n\n\n",
