	"summary": "pptpd - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nTimo Sirainen discovered a vulnerability in pptpd, a Point to Point\nTunneling Server, which implements PPTP-over-IPSEC and is commonly\nused to create Virtual Private Networks (VPN). By specifying a small\npacket length an attacker is able to overflow a buffer and execute\ncode under the user id that runs pptpd, probably root. An exploit for\nthis problem is already circulating.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.2-1.4.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been\nfixed in version 1.0.0-4.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.1.4-0.b3.2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pptpd package immediately.\n\n\n",
