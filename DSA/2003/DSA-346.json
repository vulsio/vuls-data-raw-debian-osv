These vulnerabilities require\naccess to a writable directory on the system in order to be exploited.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.0-3woody1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\nSee Debian [bug #200543](https://bugs.debian.org/200543).\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your phpsysinfo package.\n\n\n",
