	"summary": "dietlibc - integer overflow",
	"details": "\neEye Digital Security discovered an integer overflow in the\nxdrmem\\_getbytes() function of glibc, that is also present in dietlibc,\na small libc useful especially for small and embedded systems. This\nfunction is part of the XDR encoder/decoder derived from Sun's RPC\nimplementation. Depending upon the application, this vulnerability\ncan cause buffer overflows and could possibly be exploited to execute\narbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been\nfixed in version 0.12-2.5.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not contain dietlibc\npackages.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been\nfixed in version 0.22-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dietlibc packages.\n\n\n",
