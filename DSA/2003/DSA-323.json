	"details": "\nJakob Lell discovered a bug in the 'noroff' script included in noweb\nwhereby a temporary file was created insecurely. During a review,\nseveral other instances of this problem were found and fixed. Any of\nthese bugs could be exploited by a local user to overwrite arbitrary\nfiles owned by the user invoking the script.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.9a-7.3.\n\n\nFor old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.9a-5.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your noweb package.\n\n\n",
