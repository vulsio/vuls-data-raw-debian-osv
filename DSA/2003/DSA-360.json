	"details": "\nxfstt, a TrueType font server for the X window system was found to\ncontain two classes of vulnerabilities:\n\n\n[\\\n CAN-2003-0581](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0581): a remote attacker could send requests crafted to\n trigger any of several buffer overruns, causing a denial of service or\n possibly executing arbitrary code on the server with the privileges\n of the \"nobody\" user.\n\n\n[\\\n CAN-2003-0625](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0625): certain invalid data sent during the connection\n handshake could allow a remote attacker to read certain regions of\n memory belonging to the xfstt process. This information could be\n used for fingerprinting, or to aid in exploitation of a different\n vulnerability.\n\n\nFor the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been\nfixed in version 1.2.1-3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), CAN-2003-0581 is fixed in xfstt\n1.5-1, and CAN-2003-0625 will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your xfstt package.\n\n\n",
