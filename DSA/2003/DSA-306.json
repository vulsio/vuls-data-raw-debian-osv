	"summary": "ircii-pana - buffer overflows, integer overflow",
	"details": "\nTimo Sirainen discovered several problems in BitchX, a popular client\nfor Internet Relay Chat (IRC). A malicious server could craft special\nreply strings, triggering the client to write beyond buffer boundaries\nor allocate a negative amount of memory. This could lead to a denial\nof service if the client only crashes, but may also lead to executing\nof arbitrary code under the user id of the chatting user.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0-0c19-1.1.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been\nfixed in version 1.0-0c16-2.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0-0c19-8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your BitchX package.\n\n\n",
