	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in thttpd, a tiny HTTP\nserver.\n\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* [CAN-2002-1562](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1562): Information leak\n\n Marcus Breiing discovered that if thttpd it is used for virtual\n hosting, and an attacker supplies a specially crafted “Host:”\n header with a pathname instead of a hostname, thttpd will reveal\n information about the host system. Hence, an attacker can browse\n the entire disk.\n* [CAN-2003-0899](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0899): Arbitrary code execution\n\n Joel SĂśderberg and Christer Ăberg discovered a remote overflow which\n allows an attacker to partially overwrite the EBP register and\n hence execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.21b-11.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.23beta1-2.3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your thttpd package immediately.\n\n\n",
