This could allow a local attacker to read the\npassword and gain read/write access to the database.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.17.1-3.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a mantis\npackage.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem is fixed in version\n0.17.5-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your mantis package.\n\n\n",
