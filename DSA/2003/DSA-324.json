	"details": "\nSeveral of the packet dissectors in ethereal contain string handling\nbugs which could be exploited using a maliciously crafted packet to\ncause ethereal to consume excessive amounts of memory, crash, or\nexecute arbitrary code.\n\n\nThese vulnerabilities were announced in the following Ethereal security\nadvisory:\n\n\n\nEthereal 0.9.4 in Debian 3.0 (woody) is affected by most of the\nproblems described in the advisory, including:\n\n\n* The DCERPC dissector could try to allocate too much memory\n while trying to decode an NDR string.\n* Bad IPv4 or IPv6 prefix lengths could cause an overflow in the\n OSI dissector.\n* The tvb\\_get\\_nstringz0() routine incorrectly handled a\n zero-length buffer size.\n* The BGP, WTP, DNS, 802.11, ISAKMP, WSP, CLNP, and ISIS\n dissectors handled strings improperly.\n\n\nThe following problems do **not** affect this version:\n\n\n* The SPNEGO dissector could segfault while parsing an invalid\n ASN.1 value.\n* The RMI dissector handled strings improperly\n\n\nas these modules are not present.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.9.4-1woody5.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) these problems will be fixed in a\nfuture advisory.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems are fixed in\nversion 0.9.13-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your ethereal package.\n\n\n",
