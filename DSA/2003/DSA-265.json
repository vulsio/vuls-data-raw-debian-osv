Vulnerabilities include\narbitrary code execution, cross-site scripting and access to\nconfiguration parameters. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* CAN-2003-0152 - Remote execution of arbitrary commands as www-data\n* CAN-2003-0153 - Absolute path disclosure\n* CAN-2003-0154 - Cross site scripting attacks\n* CAN-2003-0155 - Unauthenticated access to parameters page\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3+cvs20020224-1woody1.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (potato) is not affected since it doesn't\ncontain bonsai.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.3+cvs20030317-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bonsai package.\n\n\n",
