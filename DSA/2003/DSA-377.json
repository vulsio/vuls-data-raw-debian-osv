	"summary": "wu-ftpd - insecure program execution",
	"details": "\nwu-ftpd, an FTP server, implements a feature whereby multiple files\ncan be fetched in the form of a dynamically constructed archive file,\nsuch as a tar archive. The names of the files to be included are\npassed as command line arguments to tar, without protection against\nthem being interpreted as command-line options. GNU tar supports\nseveral command line options which can be abused, by means of this\nvulnerability, to execute arbitrary programs with the privileges of\nthe wu-ftpd process.\n\n\nGeorgi Guninski pointed out that this vulnerability exists in Debian\nwoody.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6.2-3woody2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your wu-ftpd package.\n\n\n",
