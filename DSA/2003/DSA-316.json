	"summary": "nethack - buffer overflow, incorrect permissions",
	"details": "\nThe nethack and slashem packages are vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploited via a\nlong '-s' command line option. This vulnerability could be used by an\nattacker to gain gid 'games' on a system where nethack is installed.\n\n\nAdditionally, some setgid binaries in the nethack package have\nincorrect permissions, which could allow a user who gains gid 'games'\nto replace these binaries, potentially causing other users to execute\nmalicious code when they run nethack.\n\n\nNote that slashem does not contain the file permission problem\nCAN-2003-0359.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.4.0-3.0woody3.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.3.0-7potato1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems are fixed in\nversion 3.4.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your nethack package.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.0.6E4F8-4.0woody3.\n\n\nFor the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.0.5E7-3potato1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems are fixed in\nversion 0.0.6E4F8-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you update your slashem package.\n\n\n",
