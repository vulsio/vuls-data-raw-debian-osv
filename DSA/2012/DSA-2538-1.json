This may allow certain\nusers to have additional permissions (privilege escalation) or lack\nexpected permissions.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.9.3-1+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.9.4-8.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your moin packages.\n\n\n",
