	"summary": "php5 - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nThe Phar extension for PHP does not properly handle crafted tar files,\nleading to a heap-based buffer overflow. PHP applications processing\ntar files could crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nIn addition, this update addresses a regression which caused a crash\nwhen accessing a global object that is returned as $this from \\_\\_get.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.3.3-7+squeeze13.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 5.4.4~rc1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.\n\n\n",
