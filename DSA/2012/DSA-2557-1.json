	"summary": "hostapd - denial of service",
	"details": "\nTimo Warns discovered that the internal authentication server of hostapd,\na user space IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator,\nis vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing fragmented EAP-TLS\nmessages. As a result, an internal overflow checking routine terminates\nthe process. An attacker can abuse this flaw to conduct denial of service\nattacks via crafted EAP-TLS messages prior to any authentication.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:0.6.10-2+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your hostapd packages.\n\n\n",
