	"summary": "typo3-src - cross site scripting",
	"details": "\nHelmut Hummel of the TYPO3 security team discovered that TYPO3, a web\ncontent management system, is not properly sanitizing output of the\nexception handler. This allows an attacker to conduct cross-site\nscripting attacks if either third-party extensions are installed that do\nnot sanitize this output on their own or in the presence of extensions\nusing the extbase MVC framework which accept objects to controller actions.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.3.9+dfsg1-1+squeeze4.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your typo3-src packages.\n\n\n",
