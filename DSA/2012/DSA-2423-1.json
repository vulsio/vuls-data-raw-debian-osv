	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Movable Type, a blogging\nsystem:\n\n\nUnder certain circumstances, a user who has Create Entries or\nManage Blog permissions may be able to read known files on the local\nfile system.\n\n\nThe file management system contains shell command injection\nvulnerabilities, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary OS\ncommand execution by a user who has a permission to sign-in to the\nadmin script and also has a permission to upload files.\n\n\nSession hijack and cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities exist in\nthe commenting and the community script. A remote attacker could\nhijack the user session or could execute arbitrary script code on\nvictim's browser under the certain circumstances.\n\n\nTemplates which do not escape variable properly and mt-wizard.cgi\ncontain cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 4.3.8+dfsg-0+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 5.1.3+dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your movabletype-opensource packages.\n\n\n",
