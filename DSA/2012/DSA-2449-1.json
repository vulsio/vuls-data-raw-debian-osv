	"summary": "sqlalchemy - missing input sanitization",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that SQLAlchemy, an SQL toolkit and object relational\nmapper for Python, is not sanitizing input passed to the limit/offset\nkeywords to select() as well as the value passed to select.limit()/offset().\nThis allows an attacker to perform SQL injection attacks against\napplications using SQLAlchemy that do not implement their own filtering.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.6.3-3+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.6.7-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.6.7-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your sqlalchemy packages.\n\n\n",
