	"details": "\nIt has been discovered that spoofed getstatus UDP requests are being\nsent by attackers to servers for use with games derived from the\nQuake 3 engine (such as openarena). These servers respond with a\npacket flood to the victim whose IP address was impersonated by the\nattackers, causing a denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.5-5+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.8.5-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openarena packages.\n\n\n",
