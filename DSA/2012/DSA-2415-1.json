	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code\nhave been discovered in libmodplug, a library for MOD music based on\nModPlug. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-1761](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1761)\nepiphant discovered that the abc file parser is vulnerable to several\n stack-based buffer overflows that potentially lead to the execution\n of arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2011-2911](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2911)\nHossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadWav\n function is vulnerable to an integer overflow which leads to a\n heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker can exploit this flaw to\n potentially execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening\n crafted WAV files.\n* [CVE-2011-2912](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2912)\nHossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadS3M\n function is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker\n can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code by\n tricking a victim into opening crafted S3M files.\n* [CVE-2011-2913](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2913)\nHossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadAMS\n function suffers from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to\n memory corruption. An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially\n execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening crafted AMS\n files.\n* [CVE-2011-2914](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2914)\nIt was discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadDSM function suffers\n from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to memory corruption.\n An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary\n code by tricking a victim into opening crafted DSM files.\n* [CVE-2011-2915](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2915)\nIt was discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadAMS2 function suffers\n from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to memory corruption.\n An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary\n code by tricking a victim into opening crafted AMS files.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:0.8.8.1-1+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem\nhas been fixed in version 1:0.8.8.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libmodplug packages.\n\n\n",
