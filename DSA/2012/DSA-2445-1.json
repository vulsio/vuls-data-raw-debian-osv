A\n valid backend user is required to exploit these\n vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2012-1607](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1607)\nAccessing a CLI Script directly with a browser may disclose\n the database name used for the TYPO3 installation.\n* [CVE-2012-1608](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1608)\nBy not removing non printable characters, the API method\n t3lib\\_div::RemoveXSS() fails to filter specially crafted HTML\n injections, thus is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.3.9+dfsg1-1+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4.5.14+dfsg1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your typo3-src packages.\n\n\n",
