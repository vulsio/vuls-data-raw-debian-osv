	"details": "\nSeveral issues have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The\nvulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MySQL to a new upstream version,\n5.1.66, which includes additional changes, such as performance improvements and\ncorrections for data loss defects. These changes are described in the \n[\\\nMySQL release notes](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-66.html).\n\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), these\nproblems have been fixed in version 5.5.28+dfsg-1.\n\n\nAdditionally, [CVE-2012-5611](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5611)\nhas been fixed in this upload. The vulnerability\n(discovered independently by Tomas Hoger from the Red Hat Security Response\nTeam and king cope) is a stack-based buffer overflow in acl\\_get() when\nchecking user access to a database. Using a carefully crafted database name, an\nalready authenticated MySQL user could make the server crash or even execute\narbitrary code as the mysql system user.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version\n5.1.66-0+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this\nproblem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.1 packages.\n\n\n",
