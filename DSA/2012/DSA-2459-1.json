This release includes other corrections, such as\nhardening against unknown BGP path attributes.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.99.20.1-0+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.20.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.\n\n\n",
