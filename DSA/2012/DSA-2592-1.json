	"details": "\nMarko Myllynen discovered that ELinks, a powerful text-mode browser,\nincorrectly delegates user credentials during GSS-Negotiate.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.12~pre5-2+squeeze1. Since the initial Squeeze release,\nXULRunner needed to be updated and the version currently in the archive\nis incompatible with ELinks. As such, JavaScript support needed to be\ndisabled (only a small subset of typical functionality was supported\nanyway). It will likely be re-enabled in a later point update.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.12~pre5-9.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.12~pre5-9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your elinks packages.\n\n\n",
