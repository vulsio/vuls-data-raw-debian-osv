	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an\nimplementation of the Oracle Java platform.\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-3377](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3377)\nThe IcedTea browser plugin included in the openjdk-6 package\n does not properly enforce the Same Origin Policy on web content\n served under a domain name which has a common suffix with the\n required domain name.\n* [CVE-2011-3563](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3563)\nThe Java Sound component did not properly check for array\n boundaries. A malicious input or an untrusted Java application\n or applet could use this flaw to cause Java Virtual Machine to\n crash or disclose portion of its memory.\n* [CVE-2011-5035](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-5035)\nThe OpenJDK embedded web server did not guard against an\n excessive number of a request parameters, leading to a denial\n of service vulnerability involving hash collisions.\n* [CVE-2012-0497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0497)\nIt was discovered that Java2D did not properly check graphics\n rendering objects before passing them to the native renderer.\n This could lead to JVM crash or Java sandbox bypass.\n* [CVE-2012-0501](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0501)\nThe ZIP central directory parser used by java.util.zip.ZipFile\n entered an infinite recursion in native code when processing a\n crafted ZIP file, leading to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2012-0502](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0502)\nA flaw was found in the AWT KeyboardFocusManager class that\n could allow untrusted Java applets to acquire keyboard focus\n and possibly steal sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2012-0503](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0503)\nThe java.util.TimeZone.setDefault() method lacked a security\n manager invocation, allowing an untrusted Java application or\n applet to set a new default time zone.\n* [CVE-2012-0505](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0505)\nThe Java serialization code leaked references to serialization\n exceptions, possibly leaking critical objects to untrusted\n code in Java applets and applications.\n* [CVE-2012-0506](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0506)\nIt was discovered that CORBA implementation in Java did not\n properly protect repository identifiers (that can be obtained\n using \\_ids() method) on certain Corba objects. This could\n have been used to perform modification of the data that should\n have been immutable.\n* [CVE-2012-0507](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0507)\nThe AtomicReferenceArray class implementation did not properly\n check if the array is of an expected Object[] type. A\n malicious Java application or applet could use this flaw to\n cause Java Virtual Machine to crash or bypass Java sandbox\n restrictions.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 6b18-1.8.13-0+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 6b24-1.11.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.\n\n\n",
