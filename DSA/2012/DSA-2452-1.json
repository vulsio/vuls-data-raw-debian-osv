	],
	"summary": "apache2 - insecure default configuration",
	"details": "\nNiels Heinen noticed a security issue with the default Apache\nconfiguration on Debian if certain scripting modules like mod\\_php or\nmod\\_rivet are installed. The problem arises because the directory\n/usr/share/doc, which is mapped to the URL /doc, may contain example\nscripts that can be executed by requests to this URL. Although access\nto the URL /doc is restricted to connections from localhost, this still\ncreates security issues in two specific configurations:\n\n\n* if some front-end server on the same host forwards connections to an\napache2 backend server on the localhost address, or\n* if the machine running apache2 is also used for web browsing.\n\n\nSystems not meeting one of these two conditions are not known to be\nvulnerable. The actual security impact depends on which packages (and\naccordingly which example scripts) are installed on the system.\nPossible issues include cross site scripting, code execution, or\nleakage of sensitive data.\n\n\nThis updates removes the problematic configuration sections from the\nfiles /etc/apache2/sites-available/default and .../default-ssl. When\nupgrading, you should not blindly allow dpkg to replace those files,\nthough. Rather you should merge the changes, namely the removal of the\nAlias /doc \"/usr/share/doc\" line and the related <Directory\n\"/usr/share/doc/\"> block, into your versions of these config files.\nYou may also want to check if you have copied these sections to any\nadditional virtual host configurations.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.16-6+squeeze7.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed in\nversion 2.2.22-4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed in\nversion 2.2.22-4.\n\n\nFor the experimental distribution, this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.1-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages and adjust your\nconfiguration.\n\n\n",
