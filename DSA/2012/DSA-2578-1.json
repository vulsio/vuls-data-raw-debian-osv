	"summary": "rssh - several",
	"details": "\nJames Clawson discovered that rssh, a restricted shell for OpenSSH to be used\nwith scp, sftp, rdist and cvs, was not correctly filtering command line options.\nThis could be used to force the execution of a remote script and thus allow\narbitrary command execution. Two CVE were assigned:\n\n\n* [CVE-2012-2251](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2251)\nIncorrect filtering of command line when using rsync protocol. It was\n for example possible to pass dangerous options after a -- switch. The rsync\n protocol support has been added in a Debian (and Fedora/Red Hat) specific\n patch, so this vulnerability doesn't affect upstream.\n* [CVE-2012-2252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2252)\nIncorrect filtering of the --rsh option: the filter preventing usage of the\n --rsh= option would not prevent passing --rsh. This vulnerability affects\n upstream code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.2-13squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.3-6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.3-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.\n\n\n",
