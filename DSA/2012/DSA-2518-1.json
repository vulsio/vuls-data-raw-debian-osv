This can lead to process crash or even arbitrary\n code execution.\n\n\nThis CVE only affects testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions.\n* [CVE-2012-1015](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1015)\nBy sending specially crafted AS-REQ to a KDC, an attacker could make it\n dereference an uninitialized pointer, leading to process crash or even\n arbitrary code execution\n\n\nIn both cases, arbitrary code execution is believed to be difficult to achieve,\nbut might not be impossible.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.8.3+dfsg-4squeeze6.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.10.1+dfsg-2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.10.1+dfsg-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.\n\n\n",
