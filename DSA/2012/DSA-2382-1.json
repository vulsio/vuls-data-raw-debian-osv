	"details": "\nSeveral problems have been discovered in eCryptfs, a cryptographic\nfilesystem for Linux.\n\n\n* [CVE-2011-1831](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1831)\nVasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs\n incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local\n attacker could use this flaw to mount to arbitrary locations, leading\n to privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2011-1832](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1832)\nVasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs\n incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local\n attacker could use this flaw to unmount to arbitrary locations, leading\n to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2011-1834](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1834)\nDan Rosenberg and Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly\n handled modifications to the mtab file when an error occurs. A local\n attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file, and possibly\n unmount arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2011-1835](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1835)\nMarc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled keys when\n setting up an encrypted private directory. A local attacker could use\n this flaw to manipulate keys during creation of a new user.\n* [CVE-2011-1837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1837)\nVasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled\n lock counters. A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly overwrite\n arbitrary files.\n\n\nWe acknowledge the work of the Ubuntu distribution in preparing patches\nsuitable for near-direct inclusion in the Debian package.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 68-1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 83-4+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),\nthese problems have been fixed in version 95-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your ecryptfs-utils packages.\n\n\n",
