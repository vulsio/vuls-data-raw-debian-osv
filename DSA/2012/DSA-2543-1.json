	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xen-qemu-dm-4.0, the Xen\nQEMU Device Model virtual machine hardware emulator. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2012-3515](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3515):\n\n The device model for HVM domains does not properly handle VT100\n escape sequences when emulating certain devices with a virtual\n console backend. An attacker within a guest with access to the\n vulnerable virtual console could overwrite memory of the device\n model and escalate privileges to that of the device model process.\n* [CVE-2012-4411](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4411):\n\n The QEMU monitor was enabled by default, allowing administrators of\n a guest to access resources of the host, possibly escalate privileges\n or access resources belonging to another guest.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.0.1-2+squeeze2.\n\n\nThe testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),\nno longer contain this package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xen-qemu-dm-4.0 packages.\n\n\n",
