	"summary": "beaker - information disclosure",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that Beaker, a cache and session library for Python,\nwhen using the python-crypto backend, is vulnerable to information\ndisclosure due to a cryptographic weakness related to the use of the\nAES cipher in ECB mode.\n\n\nSystems that have the python-pycryptopp package should not be\nvulnerable, as this backend is preferred over python-crypto.\n\n\nAfter applying this update, existing sessions will be invalidated.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.5.4-4+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.6.3-1.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your beaker packages.\n\n\n",
