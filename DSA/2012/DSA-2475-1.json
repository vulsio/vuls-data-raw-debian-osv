	"details": "\nIt was discovered that openssl did not correctly handle explicit\nInitialization Vectors for CBC encryption modes, as used in TLS 1.1,\n1.2, and DTLS. An incorrect calculation would lead to an integer\nunderflow and incorrect memory access, causing denial of service\n(application crash.)\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.9.8o-4squeeze13.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.0.1c-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\n",
