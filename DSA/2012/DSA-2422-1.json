	"details": "\nThe file type identification tool, file, and its associated library,\nlibmagic, do not properly process malformed files in the Composite\nDocument File (CDF) format, leading to crashes.\n\n\nNote that after this update, file may return different detection\nresults for CDF files (well-formed or not). The new detections are\nbelieved to be more accurate.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.04-5+squeeze2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your file packages.\n\n\n",
