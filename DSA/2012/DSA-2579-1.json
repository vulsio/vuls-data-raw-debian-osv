	"details": "\nA vulnerability has been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:\n\n\n* [CVE-2012-4557](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4557)\nA flaw was found when mod\\_proxy\\_ajp connects to a backend\n server that takes too long to respond. Given a specific\n configuration, a remote attacker could send certain requests,\n putting a backend server into an error state until the retry\n timeout expired. This could lead to a temporary denial of\n service.\n\n\nIn addition, this update also adds a server side mitigation for the\nfollowing issue:\n\n\n* [CVE-2012-4929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929)\nIf using SSL/TLS data compression with HTTPS in an connection\n to a web browser, man-in-the-middle attackers may obtain\n plaintext HTTP headers. This issue is known as the CRIME\n attack. This update of apache2 disables SSL compression by\n default. A new SSLCompression directive has been backported\n that may be used to re-enable SSL data compression in\n environments where the CRIME attack is not an issue.\n For more information, please refer to the [SSLCompression\n Directive documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcompression).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.16-6+squeeze10.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.22-12.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.22-12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\n",
