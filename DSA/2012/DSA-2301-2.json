	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web\napplication framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-4214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4214)\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the\n strip\\_tags function. An attacker may inject non-printable characters\n that certain browsers will then evaluate. This vulnerability only\n affects the oldstable distribution (lenny).\n* [CVE-2011-2930](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2930)\nA SQL injection vulnerability had been found in the quote\\_table\\_name\n method that could allow malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL into a\n query.\n* [CVE-2011-2931](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2931)\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the\n strip\\_tags helper. An parsing error can be exploited by an attacker,\n who can confuse the parser and may inject HTML tags into the output\n document.\n* [CVE-2011-3186](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3186)\nA newline (CRLF) injection vulnerability had been found in\n response.rb. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary\n HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via the\n Content-Type header.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.0-7+lenny2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.14.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.\n\n\n",
