This could result in out-of-bounds\nmemory accesses and application crashes. Applications using GNUTLS\nare exposed to this issue.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.7-1+squeeze+1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.12-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.\n\n\n",
