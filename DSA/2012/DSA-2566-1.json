Specifically, crafted\nrecords can yield to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker can\nexploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.72-6+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.80-5.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.80-5.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.\n\n\n",
