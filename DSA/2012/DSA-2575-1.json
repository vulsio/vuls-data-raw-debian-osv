	"summary": "tiff - heap overflow",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that ppm2tiff of the TIFF tools, a set of utilities\nfor TIFF manipulation and conversion, is not properly checking the return\nvalue of an internal function used in order to detect integer overflows.\nAs a consequence, ppm2tiff suffers of a heap-based buffer overflow.\nThis allows attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code via a crafted\nPPM image, especially in scenarios in which images are automatically\nprocessed.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.9.4-5+squeeze7.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.0.2-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.\n\n\n",
