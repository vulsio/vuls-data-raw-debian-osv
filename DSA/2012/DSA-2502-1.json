	"details": "\nIt was discovered that that the ElGamal code in PythonCrypto, a\ncollection of cryptographic algorithms and protocols for Python used\ninsecure insufficient prime numbers in key generation, which lead to a\nweakened signature or public key space, allowing easier brute force\nattacks on such keys.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.0-2+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-crypto packages. After\ninstalling this update, previously generated keys need to be regenerated.\n\n\n",
