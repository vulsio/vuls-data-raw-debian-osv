	"details": "\ncups-pk-helper, a PolicyKit helper to configure CUPS with fine-grained\nprivileges, wraps CUPS function calls in an insecure way. This could\nlead to uploading sensitive data to a CUPS resource, or overwriting\nspecific files with the content of a CUPS resource. The user would have\nto explicitly approve the action.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.1.0-3.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.2.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cups-pk-helper packages.\n\n\n",
