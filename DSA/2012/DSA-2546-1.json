	"details": "\nTimo Warns discovered that the EAP-TLS handling of FreeRADIUS, a\nhigh-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server, is not properly\nperforming length checks on user-supplied input before copying to a local\nstack buffer. As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this\nflaw to crash the daemon or execute arbitrary code via crafted\ncertificates.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.10+dfsg-2+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.12+dfsg-1.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your freeradius packages.\n\n\n",
