The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject defines the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2012-3442](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3442)\nTwo functions do not validate the scheme of a redirect target,\n which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting\n (XSS) attacks via a data: URL.\n* [CVE-2012-3443](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3443)\nThe ImageField class completely decompresses image data during image\n validation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (memory consumption) by uploading an image file.\n* [CVE-2012-3444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3444)\nThe get\\_image\\_dimensions function in the image-handling functionality\n uses a constant chunk size in all attempts to determine dimensions,\n which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process\n or thread consumption) via a large TIFF image.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.3-3+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.\n\n\n",
