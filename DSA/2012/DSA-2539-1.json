This may\nallow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands (SQL\ninjection) and possibly escalate privileges.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:1.8.2-1squeeze4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.0.2+dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.\n\n\n",
