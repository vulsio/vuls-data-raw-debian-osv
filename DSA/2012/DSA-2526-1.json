	"summary": "libotr - buffer overflow",
	"details": "\nJust Ferguson discovered that libotr, an off-the-record (OTR) messaging\nlibrary, can be forced to perform zero-length allocations for heap buffers\nthat are used in base64 decoding routines. An attacker can exploit this\nflaw by sending crafted messages to an application that is using libotr to\nperform denial of service attacks or potentially execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.2.0-2+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.2.1-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.2.1-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libotr packages.\n\n\n",
