	"details": "\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team discovered that libproxy, a library\nfor automatic proxy configuration management, applied insufficient\nvalidation to the Content-Length header sent by a server providing a\nproxy.pac file. Such remote server could trigger an integer overflow\nand consequently overflow an in-memory buffer.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.3.1-2+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.3.1-5.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libproxy packages.\n\n\n",
