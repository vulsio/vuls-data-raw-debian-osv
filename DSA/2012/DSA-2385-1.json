	"details": "\nRay Morris discovered that the PowerDNS authoritative server responds\nto response packets. An attacker who can spoof the source address of\nIP packets can cause an endless packet loop between a PowerDNS\nauthoritative server and another DNS server, leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.9.21.2-1+lenny1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.9.22-8+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.\n\n\n",
