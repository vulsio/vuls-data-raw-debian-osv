	"summary": "cyrus-imapd-2.2 - denial of service",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that cyrus-imapd, a highly scalable mail system designed\nfor use in enterprise environments, is not properly parsing mail headers\nwhen a client makes use of the IMAP threading feature. As a result, a NULL\npointer is dereferenced which crashes the daemon. An attacker can trigger\nthis by sending a mail containing crafted reference headers and access the\nmail with a client that uses the server threading feature of IMAP.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.13-14+lenny6.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.2.13-19+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem has been\nfixed in cyrus-imapd-2.4 version 2.4.11-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.\n\n\n",
