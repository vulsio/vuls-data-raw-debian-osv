Cookie\n files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, and the vulnerability\n allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files the users has\n write permissions for, and are also world-readable which may cause\n information leak.\n* [CVE-2010-4337](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4337)\nJakub Wilk discovered an unsafe management of temporary files during the\n build process. Files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, and the\n vulnerability allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files\n the users has write permissions for.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.8-5+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.10-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gnash packages.\n\n\n",
