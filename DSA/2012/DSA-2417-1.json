	"summary": "libxml2 - denial of service",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that the internal hashing routine of libxml2,\na library providing an extensive API to handle XML data, is vulnerable to\npredictable hash collisions. Given an attacker with knowledge of the\nhashing algorithm, it is possible to craft input that creates a large\namount of collisions. As a result it is possible to perform denial of\nservice attacks against applications using libxml2 functionality because\nof the computational overhead.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.7.8.dfsg-2+squeeze3.\n\n\nFor the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem\nwill be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.\n\n\n",
