	"summary": "linux-2.6 - several",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead\nto a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2009-4307](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4307)\nNageswara R Sastry reported an issue in the ext4 filesystem. Local users\n with the privileges to mount a filesystem can cause a denial of service\n (BUG) by providing a s\\_log\\_groups\\_per\\_flex value greater than 31.\n* [CVE-2011-1833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1833)\nVasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered an information\n leak in the eCryptfs filesystem. Local users were able to mount arbitrary\n directories.\n* [CVE-2011-4347](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4347)\nSasha Levin reported an issue in the device assignment functionality in\n KVM. Local users with permission to access /dev/kvm could assign unused pci\n devices to a guest and cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2012-0045](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0045)\nStephan Barwolf reported an issue in KVM. Local users in a 32-bit guest\n running on a 64-bit system can crash the guest with a syscall instruction.\n* [CVE-2012-1090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1090)\nCAI Qian reported an issue in the CIFS filesystem. A reference count leak\n can occur during the lookup of special files, resulting in a denial of\n service (oops) on umount.\n* [CVE-2012-1097](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1097)\nH. Peter Anvin reported an issue in the regset infrastructure. Local users\n can cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by triggering the\n write methods of readonly regsets.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version\n2.6.32-41squeeze2.\n\n\nThe following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for\ncompatibility with or to take advantage of this update:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Debian 6.0 (squeeze) |\n| --- | --- |\n| user-mode-linux | 2.6.32-1um-4+41squeeze2 |\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.\n\n\nThanks to Micah Anderson for proof reading this text.\n\n\n",
