If you\nneed access to this information, you need to enable the proc PMDA.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.3.3-squeeze2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.6.5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pcp packages.\n\n\n",
