	"details": "\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, Debian's\nversion of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2012-3982](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3982)\nMultiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine\n allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory\n corruption and application crash) or possibly execute\n arbitrary code via unknown vectors.\n* [CVE-2012-3986](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3986)\nIcedove does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils\n methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended\n access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.\n* [CVE-2012-3990](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3990)\nA Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager\n implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary\n code via unspecified vectors, related to the\n nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.\n* [CVE-2012-3991](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3991)\nIcedove does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the\n GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass\n the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other\n impact via a crafted web site.\n* [CVE-2012-4179](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4179)\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the\n nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote\n attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of\n service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.\n* [CVE-2012-4180](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4180)\nA heap-based buffer overflow in the\n nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows\n remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified\n vectors.\n* [CVE-2012-4182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4182)\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the\n nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers\n to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap\n memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.\n* [CVE-2012-4186](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4186)\nA heap-based buffer overflow in the\n nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers\n to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n* [CVE-2012-4188](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4188)\nA heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function\n allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via\n unspecified vectors.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.0.11-1+squeeze14.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 10.0.9-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.\n\n\n",
