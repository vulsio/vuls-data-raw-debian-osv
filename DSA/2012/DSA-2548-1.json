This could lead to\n a remote crash, resulting in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2012-3519](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3519)\nTry to leak less information about what relays a client is choosing to\n a side-channel attacker.\n* [CVE-2012-4419](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4419)\nBy providing specially crafted date strings to a victim tor instance,\n an attacker can cause it to run into an assertion and shut down.\n\n\nAdditionally the update to stable includes the following fixes:\n when waiting for a client to renegotiate, don't allow it to add any\n bytes to the input buffer. This fixes a potential DoS issue\n[[tor-5934](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5934), \n[tor-6007](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6007)].\n\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.2.2.39-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution, these problems have been fixed in version\n0.2.3.22-rc-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.\n\n\n",
