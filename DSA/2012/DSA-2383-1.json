	"details": "\nRobert Luberda discovered a buffer overflow in the syslog logging code of \nSuper, a tool to execute scripts (or other commands) as if they were root.\nThe default Debian configuration is not affected.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.30.0-2+lenny1. Due to a technical limitation in the Debian\narchive scripts this update cannot be released synchronously with the\nstable update. It will be available shortly.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.30.0-3+squeeze1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your super packages.\n\n\n",
