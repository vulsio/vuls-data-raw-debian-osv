The restart\n mechanism is not recommended, especially when using mod\\_perl.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.8.8-7+squeeze6.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.0.7-2 of the request-tracker4 package.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker3.8 packages.\n\n\n",
