	"details": "\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in Prosody, a lightweight\nJabber/XMPP server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-1231](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1231)\nKim Alvefur discovered a flaw in Prosody's HTTP file-serving module\n that allows it to serve requests outside of the configured public\n root directory. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to access\n private files including sensitive data. The default configuration\n does not enable the mod\\_http\\_files module and thus is not\n vulnerable.\n* [CVE-2016-1232](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1232)\nThijs Alkemade discovered that Prosody's generation of the secret\n token for server-to-server dialback authentication relied upon a\n weak random number generator that was not cryptographically secure.\n A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to guess at\n probable values of the secret key and impersonate the affected\n domain to other servers on the network.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.8.2-4+deb7u3.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.9.7-2+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your prosody packages.\n\n\n",
