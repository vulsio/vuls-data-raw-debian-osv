A remote attacker can take advantage of\n this flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash).\n* [CVE-2015-8540](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8540)\nXiao Qixue and Chen Yu discovered a flaw in the png\\_check\\_keyword\n function. A remote attacker can potentially take advantage of this\n flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash).\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.2.49-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.2.50-2+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.\n\n\n",
