	"details": "\nMarkus Vervier of X41 D-Sec GmbH discovered an integer overflow\nvulnerability in libotr, an off-the-record (OTR) messaging library, in\nthe way how the sizes of portions of incoming messages were stored. A\nremote attacker can exploit this flaw by sending crafted messages to an\napplication that is using libotr to perform denial of service attacks\n(application crash), or potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running the application.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed\nin version 3.2.1-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.1.0-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libotr packages.\n\n\n",
