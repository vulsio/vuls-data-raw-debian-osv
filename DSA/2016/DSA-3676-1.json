Since there was no sanitization on the input of\n the filenames, an attacker can directly inject code in the pathnames\n of archived directories in an ADF file.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 0.7.11a-3+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.7.11a-3+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.7.11a-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your unadf packages.\n\n\n",
