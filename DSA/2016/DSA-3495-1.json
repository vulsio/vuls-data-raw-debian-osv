	"details": "\nMarkus Krell discovered that xymon, a network- and\napplications-monitoring system, was vulnerable to the following\nsecurity issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-2054](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2054)\nThe incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the config\n command can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in\n denial of service (via application crash) or remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2016-2055](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2055)\nThe incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the config\n command can lead to an information leak by serving sensitive\n configuration files to a remote user.\n* [CVE-2016-2056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2056)\nThe commands handling password management do not properly validate\n user-supplied input, and are thus vulnerable to shell command\n injection by a remote user.\n* [CVE-2016-2057](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2057)\nIncorrect permissions on an internal queuing system allow a user\n with a local account on the xymon master server to bypass all\n network-based access control lists, and thus inject messages\n directly into xymon.\n* [CVE-2016-2058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2058)\nIncorrect escaping of user-supplied input in status webpages can\n be used to trigger reflected cross-site scripting attacks.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.3.17-6+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your xymon packages.\n\n\n",
