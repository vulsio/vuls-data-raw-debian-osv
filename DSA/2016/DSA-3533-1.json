	"details": "\nKashyap Thimmaraju and Bhargava Shastry discovered a remotely\ntriggerable buffer overflow vulnerability in openvswitch, a production\nquality, multilayer virtual switch implementation. Specially crafted\nMPLS packets could overflow the buffer reserved for MPLS labels in an\nOVS internal data structure. A remote attacker can take advantage of\nthis flaw to cause a denial of service, or potentially, execution of\narbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.0+git20140819-3+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.3.0+git20140819-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openvswitch packages.\n\n\n",
