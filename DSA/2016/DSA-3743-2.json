	"details": "\nIt was discovered that bottle, a WSGI-framework for the Python\nprogramming language, did not properly filter \"\\r\\n\" sequences when\nhandling redirections. This allowed an attacker to perform CRLF\nattacks such as HTTP header injection.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.12.7-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this\nproblem has been fixed in version 0.12.11-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python-bottle packages.\n\n\n",
