By\nproviding maliciously crafted input, an attacker could use this flaw\nto force some leakage of information located in the process heap\nmemory.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1.3.0-2+deb7u1.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.1-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this\nproblem has been fixed in version 1.4.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libmatroska packages.\n\n\n",
