	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been fixed in phpMyAdmin, the web-based\nMySQL administration interface.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-1927](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1927)\nThe suggestPassword function relied on a non-secure random number\n generator which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess\n generated passwords via a brute-force approach.\n* [CVE-2016-2039](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2039)\nCSRF token values were generated by a non-secure random number\n generator, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access\n restrictions by predicting a value.\n* [CVE-2016-2040](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2040)\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2016-2041](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2041)\nphpMyAdmin does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing\n CSRF tokens, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass\n intended access restrictions by measuring time differences.\n* [CVE-2016-2560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2560)\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2016-2561](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2561)\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2016-5099](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5099)\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2016-5701](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5701)\nFor installations running on plain HTTP, phpMyAdmin allows remote\n attackers to conduct BBCode injection attacks against HTTP sessions\n via a crafted URI.\n* [CVE-2016-5705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5705)\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2016-5706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5706)\nphpMyAdmin allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n (resource consumption) via a large array in the scripts parameter.\n* [CVE-2016-5731](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5731)\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote\n attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2016-5733](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5733)\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\n* [CVE-2016-5739](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5739)\nA specially crafted Transformation could leak information which\n a remote attacker could use to perform cross site request forgeries.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4:4.2.12-2+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4:4.6.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.\n\n\n",
