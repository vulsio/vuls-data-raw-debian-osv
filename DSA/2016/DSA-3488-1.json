	"summary": "libssh - security update",
	"details": "\nAris Adamantiadis discovered that libssh, a tiny C SSH library,\nincorrectly generated a short ephemeral secret for the\ndiffie-hellman-group1 and diffie-hellman-group14 key exchange methods.\nThe resulting secret is 128 bits long, instead of the recommended sizes\nof 1024 and 2048 bits respectively. This flaw could allow an\neavesdropper with enough resources to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.5.4-1+deb7u3. This update also includes fixes for\n[CVE-2014-8132](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8132)\nand [CVE-2015-3146](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3146),\nwhich were previously scheduled for the next wheezy point release.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.6.3-4+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.\n\n\n",
