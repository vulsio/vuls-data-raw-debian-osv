This could\n lead to a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2016-2776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2776)\nA crafted query could crash the BIND name server daemon, leading\n to a denial of service. All server roles (authoritative,\n recursive and forwarding) in default configurations are \n affected.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u7.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\n",
