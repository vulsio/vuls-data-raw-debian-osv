	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-8615](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8615)\nIt was discovered that a malicious HTTP server could inject new\n cookies for arbitrary domains into a cookie jar.\n* [CVE-2016-8616](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8616)\nIt was discovered that when re-using a connection, curl was doing case\n insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing\n connections.\n* [CVE-2016-8617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8617)\nIt was discovered that on systems with 32-bit addresses in userspace\n (e.g. x86, ARM, x32), the output buffer size value calculated in the\n base64 encode function would wrap around if input size was at least\n 1GB of data, causing an undersized output buffer to be allocated.\n* [CVE-2016-8618](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8618)\nIt was discovered that the curl\\_maprintf() function could be tricked\n into doing a double-free due to an unsafe size\\_t multiplication on\n systems using 32 bit size\\_t variables.\n* [CVE-2016-8619](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8619)\nIt was discovered that the Kerberos implementation could be\n tricked into doing a double-free when reading one of the length fields\n from a socket.\n* [CVE-2016-8620](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8620)\nIt was discovered that the curl tool's globbing feature could write\n to invalid memory areas when parsing invalid ranges.\n* [CVE-2016-8621](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8621)\nIt was discovered that the function curl\\_getdate could read out of\n bounds when parsing invalid date strings.\n* [CVE-2016-8622](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8622)\nIt was discovered that the URL percent-encoding decode function would\n return a signed 32bit integer variable as length, even though it\n allocated a destination buffer larger than 2GB, which would lead to\n a out-of-bounds write.\n* [CVE-2016-8623](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8623)\nIt was discovered that libcurl could access an already-freed memory\n area due to concurrent access to shared cookies. This could lead to\n a denial of service or disclosure of sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2016-8624](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8624)\nIt was discovered that curl wouldn't parse the authority component of\n a URL correctly when the host name part ends with a '#' character,\n and could be tricked into connecting to a different host.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.38.0-4+deb8u5.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.51.0-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\n",
