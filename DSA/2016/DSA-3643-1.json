	"details": "\nAndreas Cord-Landwehr discovered that kde4libs, the core libraries\nfor all KDE 4 applications, do not properly handle the extraction\nof archives with \"../\" in the file paths. A remote attacker can\ntake advantage of this flaw to overwrite files outside of the\nextraction folder, if a user is tricked into extracting a specially\ncrafted archive.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4:4.14.2-5+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4:4.14.22-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kde4libs packages.\n\n\n",
