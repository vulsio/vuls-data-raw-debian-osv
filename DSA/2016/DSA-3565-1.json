	"details": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities were found in botan1.10, a C++\nlibrary which provides support for many common cryptographic\noperations, including encryption, authentication, X.509v3 certificates\nand CRLs.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-5726](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5726)\nThe BER decoder would crash due to reading from offset 0 of an\n empty vector if it encountered a BIT STRING which did not contain\n any data at all. This can be used to easily crash applications\n reading untrusted ASN.1 data, but does not seem exploitable for\n code execution.\n* [CVE-2015-5727](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5727)\nThe BER decoder would allocate a fairly arbitrary amount of memory\n in a length field, even if there was no chance the read request\n would succeed. This might cause the process to run out of memory or\n invoke the OOM killer.\n* [CVE-2015-7827](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7827)\nUse constant time PKCS #1 unpadding to avoid possible side channel\n attack against RSA decryption\n* [CVE-2016-2194](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2194)\nInfinite loop in modular square root algorithm.\n The ressol function implementing the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for\n finding square roots could be sent into a nearly infinite loop due\n to a misplaced conditional check. This could occur if a composite\n modulus is provided, as this algorithm is only defined for primes.\n This function is exposed to attacker controlled input via the\n OS2ECP function during ECC point decompression.\n* [CVE-2016-2195](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2195)\nFix Heap overflow on invalid ECC point.\n* [CVE-2016-2849](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2849)\nUse constant time modular inverse algorithm to avoid possible\n side channel attack against ECDSA.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.10.8-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your botan1.10 packages.\n\n\n",
