This flaw allowed a remote attacker\nto crash the application by setting up malformed DNS records, thus\ncausing a denial-of-service,\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed\nin version 2.0.5-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.0.17-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this\nproblem has been fixed in version 2.0.20-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your inspircd packages.\n\n\n",
