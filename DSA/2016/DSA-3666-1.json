	"details": "\nDawid Golunski discovered that the mysqld\\_safe wrapper provided by the\nMySQL database server insufficiently restricted the load path for custom\nmalloc implementations, which could result in privilege escalation.\n\n\nThe vulnerability was addressed by upgrading MySQL to the new upstream\nversion 5.5.52, which includes additional changes, such as performance\nimprovements, bug fixes, new features, and possibly incompatible\nchanges. Please see the MySQL 5.5 Release Notes for further details:\n\n\n* [\\\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-51.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-51.html)\n* [\\\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-52.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-52.html)\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.5.52-0+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.5 packages.\n\n\n",
