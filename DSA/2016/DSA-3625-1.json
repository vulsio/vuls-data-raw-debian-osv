	"details": "\nSeveral security issues have been discovered in the Squid caching proxy.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-4051](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4051):\n\n CESG and Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that Squid cachemgr.cgi was\n vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing remotely supplied\n inputs relayed through Squid.\n* [CVE-2016-4052](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4052):\n\n CESG discovered that a buffer overflow made Squid vulnerable to a\n Denial of Service (DoS) attack when processing ESI responses.\n* [CVE-2016-4053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4053):\n\n CESG found that Squid was vulnerable to public information\n disclosure of the server stack layout when processing ESI responses.\n* [CVE-2016-4054](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4054):\n\n CESG discovered that Squid was vulnerable to remote code execution\n when processing ESI responses.\n* [CVE-2016-4554](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4554):\n\n Jianjun Chen found that Squid was vulnerable to a header smuggling\n attack that could lead to cache poisoning and to bypass of\n same-origin security policy in Squid and some client browsers.\n* [CVE-2016-4555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4555),\n [CVE-2016-4556](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4556):\n\n \"bfek-18\" and \"@vftable\" found that Squid was vulnerable to a Denial\n of Service (DoS) attack when processing ESI responses, due to\n incorrect pointer handling and reference counting.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.4.8-6+deb8u3.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these\nproblems have been fixed in version 3.5.19-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.\n\n\n",
