	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in libxml2, a library providing\nsupport to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker\ncould provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed\nby an application using libxml2, would cause a denial-of-service against\nthe application, or potentially, the execution of arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user running the application.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.9.1+dfsg1-5+deb8u4.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2.9.4+dfsg1-2.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.9.4+dfsg1-2.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.\n\n\n",
