	"details": "\nMultiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in the Tomcat\nservlet and JSP engine, as well as in its Debian-specific maintainer\nscripts. Those flaws allowed for privilege escalation, information\ndisclosure, and remote code execution.\n\n\nAs part of this update, several regressions stemming from incomplete\nfixes for previous vulnerabilities were also fixed.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.0.56-3+deb8u6.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these\nproblems have been fixed in version 7.0.72-3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.\n\n\n",
