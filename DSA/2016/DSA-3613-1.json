	],
	"summary": "libvirt - security update",
	"details": "\nVivian Zhang and Christoph Anton Mitterer discovered that setting an\nempty VNC password does not work as documented in Libvirt, a\nvirtualisation abstraction library. When the password on a VNC server is\nset to the empty string, authentication on the VNC server will be\ndisabled, allowing any user to connect, despite the documentation\ndeclaring that setting an empty password for the VNC server prevents all\nclient connections. With this update the behaviour is enforced by\nsetting the password expiration to now.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.2.9-9+deb8u3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.0.0-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.\n\n\n",
