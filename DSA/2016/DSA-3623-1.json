	"summary": "apache2 - security update",
	"details": "\nScott Geary of VendHQ discovered that the Apache HTTPD server used the\nvalue of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the\nHTTP\\_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was\nincorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the\nproxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an\nattacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.4.10-10+deb8u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\n",
