	"summary": "openssh - security update",
	"details": "\nEddie Harari reported that the OpenSSH SSH daemon allows user\nenumeration through timing differences when trying to authenticate\nusers. When sshd tries to authenticate a non-existing user, it will pick\nup a fixed fake password structure with a hash based on the Blowfish\nalgorithm. If real users passwords are hashed using SHA256/SHA512, then\na remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw by sending large\npasswords, receiving shorter response times from the server for\nnon-existing users.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:6.7p1-5+deb8u3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:7.2p2-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.\n\n\n",
