A remote attacker can\nexploit this flaw to cause an application using the pixman library to\ncrash, or potentially, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of\nthe user running the application.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed\nin version 0.26.0-4+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), the testing distribution (stretch)\nand the unstable distribution (sid), this problem was already fixed in\nversion 0.32.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your pixman packages.\n\n\n",
