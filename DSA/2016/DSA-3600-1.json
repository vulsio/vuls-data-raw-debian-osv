	"details": "\nMultiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web\nbrowser: Multiple memory safety errors, buffer overflows and other\nimplementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or\nspoofing.\n\n\nWait, Firefox? No more references to Iceweasel? That's right, Debian no\nlonger applies a custom branding. Please see these links for further\ninformation: <https://glandium.org/blog/?p=3622>,\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_software_rebranded_by_Debian>\n\n\nDebian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support\nfor the 38.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now\nfollowing the 45.x releases and this update to the next ESR is also the\npoint where we reapply the original branding.\n\n\nTransition packages for the iceweasel packages are provided which\nautomatically upgrade to the new version. Since new binary packages need\nto be installed, make sure to allow that in your upgrade procedure (e.g.\nby using apt-get dist-upgrade instead of apt-get upgrade).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 45.2.0esr-1~deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 45.2.0esr-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.\n\n\n",
