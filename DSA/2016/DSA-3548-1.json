	"summary": "samba - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,\nprint, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-5370](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5370)\nJouni Knuutinen from Synopsys discovered flaws in the Samba DCE-RPC\n code which can lead to denial of service (crashes and high cpu\n consumption) and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n* [CVE-2016-2110](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2110)\nStefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that the\n feature negotiation of NTLMSSP does not protect against downgrade\n attacks.\n* [CVE-2016-2111](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2111)\nWhen Samba is configured as domain controller, it allows remote\n attackers to spoof the computer name of a secure channel's endpoint,\n and obtain sensitive session information. This flaw corresponds to\n the same vulnerability as [CVE-2015-0005](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0005) for Windows, discovered by\n Alberto Solino from Core Security.\n* [CVE-2016-2112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2112)\nStefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that a\n man-in-the-middle attacker can downgrade LDAP connections to avoid\n integrity protection.\n* [CVE-2016-2113](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2113)\nStefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that\n man-in-the-middle attacks are possible for client triggered LDAP\n connections and ncacn\\_http connections.\n* [CVE-2016-2114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2114)\nStefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that Samba\n does not enforce required smb signing even if explicitly configured.\n* [CVE-2016-2115](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2115)\nStefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that SMB\n connections for IPC traffic are not integrity-protected.\n* [CVE-2016-2118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2118)\nStefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that a\n man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept any DCERPC traffic between\n a client and a server in order to impersonate the client and obtain\n the same privileges as the authenticated user account.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u9. The oldstable distribution is not affected\nby [CVE-2016-2113](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2113) and [CVE-2016-2114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2114).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2:4.2.10+dfsg-0+deb8u1. The issues were addressed by upgrading\nto the new upstream version 4.2.10, which includes additional changes\nand bugfixes. The depending libraries ldb, talloc, tdb and tevent\nrequired as well an update to new upstream versions for this update.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2:4.3.7+dfsg-1.\n\n\nPlease refer to\n\n\n* [\\\nhttps://www.samba.org/samba/latest\\_news.html#4.4.2](https://www.samba.org/samba/latest_news.html#4.4.2)\n* [\\\nhttps://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.2.0.html](https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.2.0.html)\n* [\\\nhttps://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.2.10.html](https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.2.10.html)\n\n\nfor further details (in particular for new options and defaults).\n\n\nWe'd like to thank Andreas Schneider and Guenther Deschner (Red Hat),\nStefan Metzmacher and Ralph Boehme (SerNet) and Aurelien Aptel (SUSE)\nfor the massive backporting work required to support Samba 3.6 and Samba\n4.2 and Andrew Bartlett (Catalyst), Jelmer Vernooij and Mathieu Parent\nfor their help in preparing updates of Samba and the underlying\ninfrastructure libraries.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.\n\n\n",
