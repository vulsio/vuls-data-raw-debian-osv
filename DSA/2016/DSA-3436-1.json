A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this flaw to\nconduct collision attacks to impersonate a TLS server or an\nauthenticated TLS client.\n\n\nMore information can be found at\n[\\\nhttps://www.mitls.org/pages/attacks/SLOTH](https://www.mitls.org/pages/attacks/SLOTH)\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u19.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), the testing distribution (stretch)\nand the unstable distribution (sid), this issue was already addressed in\nversion 1.0.1f-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\n",
