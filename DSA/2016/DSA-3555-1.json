Kaminskiy discovered that drawing using coordinates from\n an untrusted source could lead to an out-of-bound memory read, which\n in turn could result in an application crash.\n* [CVE-2016-3994](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3994)\nJakub Wilk discovered that a malformed image could lead to an\n out-of-bound read in the GIF loader, which may result in an\n application crash or information leak.\n* [CVE-2016-4024](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4024)\nYuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered an integer overflow that could lead to\n an insufficient heap allocation and out-of-bound memory write.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.4.5-1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.6-2+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.8-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your imlib2 packages.\n\n\n",
