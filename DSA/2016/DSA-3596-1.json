	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in spice, a SPICE protocol\nclient and server library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-0749](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0749)\nJing Zhao of Red Hat discovered a memory allocation flaw, leading to\n a heap-based buffer overflow in spice's smartcard interaction. A\n user connecting to a guest VM via spice can take advantage of this\n flaw to cause a denial-of-service (QEMU process crash), or\n potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the\n privileges of the hosting QEMU process.\n* [CVE-2016-2150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2150)\nFrediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered that a malicious guest inside\n a virtual machine can take control of the corresponding QEMU process\n in the host using crafted primary surface parameters.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.12.5-1+deb8u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.\n\n\n",
