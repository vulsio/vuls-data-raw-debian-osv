	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-7515](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7515),\n [CVE-2016-2184](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2184),\n [CVE-2016-2185](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2185),\n [CVE-2016-2186](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2186),\n [CVE-2016-2187](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2187),\n [CVE-2016-3136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3136),\n [CVE-2016-3137](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3137),\n [CVE-2016-3138](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3138),\n [CVE-2016-3140](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3140)\nRalf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that various USB\n drivers do not sufficiently validate USB descriptors. This\n allowed a physically present user with a specially designed USB\n device to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2016-0821](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0821)\nSolar Designer noted that the list poisoning feature, intended\n to mitigate the effects of bugs in list manipulation in the\n kernel, used poison values within the range of virtual addresses\n that can be allocated by user processes.\n* [CVE-2016-1237](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1237)\nDavid Sinquin discovered that nfsd does not check permissions when\n setting ACLs, allowing users to grant themselves permissions to a\n file by setting the ACL.\n* [CVE-2016-1583](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1583)\nJann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that the eCryptfs\n filesystem could be used together with the proc filesystem to\n cause a kernel stack overflow. If the ecryptfs-utils package is\n installed, local users could exploit this, via the\n mount.ecryptfs\\_private program, for denial of service (crash) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-2117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2117)\nJustin Yackoski of Cryptonite discovered that the Atheros L2\n ethernet driver incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote\n attacker could take advantage of this flaw to obtain potentially\n sensitive information from kernel memory.\n* [CVE-2016-2143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2143)\nMarcin Koscielnicki discovered that the fork implementation in the\n Linux kernel on s390 platforms mishandles the case of four\n page-table levels, which allows local users to cause a denial of\n service (system crash).\n* [CVE-2016-3070](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3070)\nJan Stancek of Red Hat discovered a local denial of service\n vulnerability in AIO handling.\n* [CVE-2016-3134](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3134)\nThe Google Project Zero team found that the netfilter subsystem does\n not sufficiently validate filter table entries. A user with the\n CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability could use this for denial of service\n (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. Debian disables\n unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled with the\n kernel.unprivileged\\_userns\\_clone sysctl, this allows privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-3156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3156)\nSolar Designer discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux\n kernel did not perform the destruction of inet device objects\n properly. An attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial\n of service (networking outage) in the host OS.\n* [CVE-2016-3157](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3157) /\n XSA-171\n\n Andy Lutomirski discovered that the x86\\_64 (amd64) task switching\n implementation did not correctly update the I/O permission level\n when running as a Xen paravirtual (PV) guest. In some\n configurations this would allow local users to cause a denial of\n service (crash) or to escalate their privileges within the guest.\n* [CVE-2016-3672](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3672)\nHector Marco and Ismael Ripoll noted that it was possible to disable\n Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) for x86\\_32 (i386) programs\n by removing the stack resource limit. This made it easier for local\n users to exploit security flaws in programs that have the setuid or\n setgid flag set.\n* [CVE-2016-3951](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3951)\nIt was discovered that the cdc\\_ncm driver would free memory\n prematurely if certain errors occurred during its initialisation.\n This allowed a physically present user with a specially designed\n USB device to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to\n escalate their privileges.\n* [CVE-2016-3955](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3955)\nIgnat Korchagin reported that the usbip subsystem did not check\n the length of data received for a USB buffer. This allowed denial\n of service (crash) or privilege escalation on a system configured\n as a usbip client, by the usbip server or by an attacker able to\n impersonate it over the network. A system configured as a usbip\n server might be similarly vulnerable to physically present users.\n* [CVE-2016-3961](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3961) /\n XSA-174\n\n Vitaly Kuznetsov of Red Hat discovered that Linux allowed the use of\n hugetlbfs on x86 (i386 and amd64) systems even when running as a Xen\n paravirtualised (PV) guest, although Xen does not support huge\n pages. This allowed users with access to /dev/hugepages to cause a\n denial of service (crash) in the guest.\n* [CVE-2016-4470](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4470)\nDavid Howells of Red Hat discovered that a local user can trigger a\n flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of key lookups in the keychain\n subsystem, leading to a denial of service (crash) or possibly to\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-4482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4482),\n [CVE-2016-4485](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4485),\n [CVE-2016-4486](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4486),\n [CVE-2016-4569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4569),\n [CVE-2016-4578](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4578),\n [CVE-2016-4580](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4580),\n [CVE-2016-5243](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5243),\n [CVE-2016-5244](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5244)\nKangjie Lu reported that the USB devio, llc, rtnetlink, ALSA\n timer, x25, tipc, and rds facilities leaked information from the\n kernel stack.\n* [CVE-2016-4565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4565)\nJann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that various components\n in the InfiniBand stack implemented unusual semantics for the\n write() operation. On a system with InfiniBand drivers loaded,\n local users could use this for denial of service or privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-4581](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4581)\nTycho Andersen discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel\n did not handle propagated mounts correctly. A local user can take\n advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n* [CVE-2016-4805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4805)\nBaozeng Ding discovered a use-after-free in the generic PPP layer in\n the Linux kernel. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to\n cause a denial of service (system crash), or potentially escalate\n their privileges.\n* [CVE-2016-4913](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4913)\nAl Viro found that the ISO9660 filesystem implementation did not\n correctly count the length of certain invalid name entries.\n Reading a directory containing such name entries would leak\n information from kernel memory. Users permitted to mount disks or\n disk images could use this to obtain sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2016-4997](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4997) /\n [CVE-2016-4998](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4998)\nJesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that missing input sanitising\n in Netfilter socket handling may result in denial of service. Debian\n disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled\n with the kernel.unprivileged\\_userns\\_clone sysctl, this also allows\n privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\n",
