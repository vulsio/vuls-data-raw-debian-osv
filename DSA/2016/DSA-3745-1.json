	"details": "\nSaulius Lapinskas from Lithuanian State Social Insurance Fund Board\ndiscovered that Squid3, a fully featured web proxy cache, does not\nproperly process responses to If-None-Modified HTTP conditional\nrequests, leading to client-specific Cookie data being leaked to other\nclients. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to discover\nprivate and sensitive information about another clients browsing\nsession.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.4.8-6+deb8u4. In addition, this update includes a fix for\n\\#819563.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.5.23-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.\n\n\n",
