	"details": "\nThe wheezy part of the previous gajim update, DSA-3492-1, was\nincorrectly built resulting in an unsatisfiable dependency. This update\ncorrects that problem. For reference, the original advisory text\nfollows.\n\n\nDaniel Gultsch discovered a vulnerability in Gajim, an XMPP/jabber\nclient. Gajim didn't verify the origin of roster update, allowing an\nattacker to spoof them and potentially allowing her to intercept\nmessages.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed\nin version 0.15.1-4.1+deb7u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.16-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed\nin version 0.16.5-0.1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.16.5-0.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gajim packages.\n\n\n",
