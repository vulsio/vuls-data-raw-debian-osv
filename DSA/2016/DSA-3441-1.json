	"details": "\nDavid Golden of MongoDB discovered that File::Spec::canonpath() in Perl\nreturned untainted strings even if passed tainted input. This defect\nundermines taint propagation, which is sometimes used to ensure that\nunvalidated user input does not reach sensitive code.\n\n\nThe oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not affected by this problem.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.20.2-3+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.\n\n\n",
