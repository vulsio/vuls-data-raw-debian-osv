	"details": "\nJann Horn discovered a vulnerability in the fuse (Filesystem in\nUserspace) package in Debian. The fuse package ships an udev rule\nadjusting permissions on the related /dev/cuse character device, making\nit world writable.\n\n\nThis permits a local, unprivileged attacker to create an\narbitrarily-named character device in /dev and modify the memory of any\nprocess that opens it and performs an ioctl on it.\n\n\nThis in turn might allow a local, unprivileged attacker to escalate to\nroot privileges.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), the fuse package is not affected.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.9.3-15+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed\nin version 2.9.5-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.9.5-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your fuse packages.\n\n\n",
