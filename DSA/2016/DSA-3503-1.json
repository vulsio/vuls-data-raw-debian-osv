	"summary": "linux - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, information\nleak or data loss.\n\n\n* [CVE-2013-4312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4312),\n[CVE-2016-2847](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2847)\nTetsuo Handa discovered that users can use pipes queued on local\n (Unix) sockets to allocate an unfair share of kernel memory, leading\n to denial-of-service (resource exhaustion).\n\n\nThis issue was previously mitigated for the stable suite by limiting\n the total number of files queued by each user on local sockets. The\n new kernel version in both suites includes that mitigation plus\n limits on the total size of pipe buffers allocated for each user.\n* [CVE-2015-7566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7566)\nRalf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that the visor\n driver crashes when a specially crafted USB device without bulk-out\n endpoint is detected.\n* [CVE-2015-8767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8767)\nAn SCTP denial-of-service was discovered which can be triggered by a\n local attacker during a heartbeat timeout event after the 4-way\n handshake.\n* [CVE-2015-8785](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8785)\nIt was discovered that local users permitted to write to a file on a\n FUSE filesystem could cause a denial of service (unkillable loop in\n the kernel).\n* [CVE-2015-8812](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8812)\nA flaw was found in the iw\\_cxgb3 Infiniband driver. Whenever it\n could not send a packet because the network was congested, it would\n free the packet buffer but later attempt to send the packet again.\n This use-after-free could result in a denial of service (crash or\n hang), data loss or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2015-8816](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8816)\nA use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the USB hub driver.\n This may be used by a physically present user for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2015-8830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8830)\nBen Hawkes of Google Project Zero reported that the AIO interface\n permitted reading or writing 2 GiB of data or more in a single\n chunk, which could lead to an integer overflow when applied to\n certain filesystems, socket or device types. The full security\n impact has not been evaluated.\n* [CVE-2016-0723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0723)\nA use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the TIOCGETD ioctl.\n A local attacker could use this flaw for denial-of-service.\n* [CVE-2016-0774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0774)\nIt was found that the fix for [CVE-2015-1805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1805) in kernel versions older\n than Linux 3.16 did not correctly handle the case of a partially\n failed atomic read. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw\n to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user space.\n* [CVE-2016-2069](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2069)\nAndy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in flushing of the TLB\n when switching tasks on an x86 system. On an SMP system this could\n possibly lead to a crash, information leak or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-2384](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2384)\nAndrey Konovalov found that a crafted USB MIDI device with an\n invalid USB descriptor could trigger a double-free. This may be used\n by a physically present user for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-2543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2543)\nDmitry Vyukov found that the core sound sequencer driver (snd-seq)\n lacked a necessary check for a null pointer, allowing a user\n with access to a sound sequencer device to cause a denial-of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2016-2544](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2544),\n[CVE-2016-2546](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2546),\n[CVE-2016-2547](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2547),\n[CVE-2016-2548](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2548)\nDmitry Vyukov found various race conditions in the sound subsystem\n (ALSA)'s management of timers. A user with access to sound devices\n could use these to cause a denial-of-service (crash or hang) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-2545](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2545)\nDmitry Vyukov found a flaw in list manipulation in the sound\n subsystem (ALSA)'s management of timers. A user with access to sound\n devices could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash or hang)\n or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2016-2549](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2549)\nDmitry Vyukov found a potential deadlock in the sound subsystem\n (ALSA)'s use of high resolution timers. A user with access to sound\n devices could use this to cause a denial-of-service (hang).\n* [CVE-2016-2550](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2550)\nThe original mitigation of\n [CVE-2013-4312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4312),\n limiting the total number\n of files a user could queue on local sockets, was flawed. A user\n given a local socket opened by another user, for example through the\n systemd socket activation mechanism, could make use of the other\n user's quota, again leading to a denial-of-service (resource\n exhaustion). This is fixed by accounting queued files to the sender\n rather than the socket opener.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.2.73-2+deb7u3. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not\naffected by [CVE-2015-8830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8830).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u4. [CVE-2013-4312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4312), [CVE-2015-7566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7566), [CVE-2015-8767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8767) and\n[CVE-2016-0723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0723) were already fixed in DSA-3448-1. [CVE-2016-0774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0774) does not\naffect the stable distribution.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\n",
