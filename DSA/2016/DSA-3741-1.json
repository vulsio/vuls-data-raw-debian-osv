This issue may enable a hostile hidden\nservice to crash Tor clients depending on hardening options and malloc\nimplementation.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.2.5.12-4.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this\nproblem has been fixed in version 0.2.9.8-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.\n\n\n",
