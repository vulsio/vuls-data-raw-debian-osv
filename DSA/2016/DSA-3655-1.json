An\n attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause an application\n crash (denial-of-service), or potentially to execute arbitrary code\n with the privileges of the user running MuPDF, if a specially\n crafted PDF file is processed.\n* [CVE-2016-6525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6525)\nYu Hong and Zheng Jihong discovered a heap overflow vulnerability\n within the pdf\\_load\\_mesh\\_params function, allowing an attacker to\n cause an application crash (denial-of-service), or potentially to\n execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\n MuPDF, if a specially crafted PDF file is processed.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.5-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mupdf packages.\n\n\n",
