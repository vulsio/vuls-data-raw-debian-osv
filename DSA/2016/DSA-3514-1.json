	"summary": "samba - security update",
	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,\nprint, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-7560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7560)\nJeremy Allison of Google, Inc. and the Samba Team discovered that\n Samba incorrectly handles getting and setting ACLs on a symlink\n path. An authenticated malicious client can use SMB1 UNIX extensions\n to create a symlink to a file or directory, and then use non-UNIX\n SMB1 calls to overwrite the contents of the ACL on the file or\n directory linked to.\n* [CVE-2016-0771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0771)\nGarming Sam and Douglas Bagnall of Catalyst IT discovered that Samba\n is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read issue during DNS TXT record\n handling, if Samba is deployed as an AD DC and chosen to run the\n internal DNS server. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to\n cause a denial of service (Samba crash), or potentially, to allow\n leakage of memory from the server in the form of a DNS TXT reply.\n\n\nAdditionally this update includes a fix for a regression introduced due\nto the upstream fix for [CVE-2015-5252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5252) in DSA-3433-1 in setups where the\nshare path is '/'.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u7. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not\naffected by [CVE-2016-0771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0771).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2:4.1.17+dfsg-2+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2:4.3.6+dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.\n\n\n",
