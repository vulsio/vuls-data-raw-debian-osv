	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation\nof Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-8629](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8629)\nIt was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind\n to read beyond the end of allocated memory by sending a string\n without a terminating zero byte. Information leakage may be possible\n for an attacker with permission to modify the database.\n* [CVE-2015-8630](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8630)\nIt was discovered that an authenticated attacker with permission to\n modify a principal entry can cause kadmind to dereference a null\n pointer by supplying a null policy value but including KADM5\\_POLICY\n in the mask.\n* [CVE-2015-8631](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8631)\nIt was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind\n to leak memory by supplying a null principal name in a request which\n uses one. Repeating these requests will eventually cause kadmind to\n exhaust all available memory.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u7. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is\nnot affected by [CVE-2015-8630](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8630).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.12.1+dfsg-19+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.\n\n\n",
