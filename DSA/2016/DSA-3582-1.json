	"summary": "expat - security update",
	"details": "\nGustavo Grieco discovered that Expat, an XML parsing C library, does not\nproperly handle certain kinds of malformed input documents, resulting in\nbuffer overflows during processing and error reporting. A remote\nattacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause an application using\nthe Expat library to crash, or potentially, to execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the user running the application.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2.1.0-6+deb8u2. Additionally this update refreshes the fix for\n[CVE-2015-1283](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1283) to avoid relying on undefined behavior.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.\n\n\n",
