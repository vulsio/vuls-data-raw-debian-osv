	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control\nsystem. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-2167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2167)\nDaniel Shahaf and James McCoy discovered that an implementation\n error in the authentication against the Cyrus SASL library would\n permit a remote user to specify a realm string which is a prefix of\n the expected realm string and potentially allowing a user to\n authenticate using the wrong realm.\n* [CVE-2016-2168](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2168)\nIvan Zhakov of VisualSVN discovered a remotely triggerable denial\n of service vulnerability in the mod\\_authz\\_svn module during COPY or\n MOVE authorization check. An authenticated remote attacker could\n take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service\n (Subversion server crash) via COPY or MOVE requests with specially\n crafted header.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.8.10-6+deb8u4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.9.4-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.\n\n\n",
