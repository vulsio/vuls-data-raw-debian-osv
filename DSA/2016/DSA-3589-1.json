A remote attacker can\ntake advantage of these flaws to cause a denial-of-service against an\napplication using gdk-pixbuf (application crash), or potentially, to\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the\napplication, if a malformed image is opened.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.31.1-2+deb8u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gdk-pixbuf packages.\n\n\n",
