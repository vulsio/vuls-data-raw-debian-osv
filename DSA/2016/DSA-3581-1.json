	"details": "\nJulien Bernard discovered that libndp, a library for the IPv6 Neighbor\nDiscovery Protocol, does not properly perform input and origin checks\nduring the reception of a NDP message. An attacker in a non-local\nnetwork could use this flaw to advertise a node as a router, and cause a\ndenial of service attack, or act as a man-in-the-middle.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4-2+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libndp packages.\n\n\n",
