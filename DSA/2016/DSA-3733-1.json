	"summary": "apt - security update",
	"details": "\nJann Horn of Google Project Zero discovered that APT, the high level\npackage manager, does not properly handle errors when validating\nsignatures on InRelease files. An attacker able to man-in-the-middle\nHTTP requests to an apt repository that uses InRelease files\n(clearsigned Release files), can take advantage of this flaw to\ncircumvent the signature of the InRelease file, leading to arbitrary\ncode execution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.0.9.8.4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4~beta2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.\n\n\n",
