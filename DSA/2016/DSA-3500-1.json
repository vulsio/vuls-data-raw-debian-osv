	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer\ntoolkit.\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-0702](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0702)\nYuval Yarom from the University of Adelaide and NICTA, Daniel Genkin\n from Technion and Tel Aviv University, and Nadia Heninger from the\n University of Pennsylvania discovered a side-channel attack which\n makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge\n microarchitecture. This could allow local attackers to recover RSA\n private keys.\n* [CVE-2016-0705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0705)\nAdam Langley from Google discovered a double free bug when parsing\n malformed DSA private keys. This could allow remote attackers to\n cause a denial of service or memory corruption in applications\n parsing DSA private keys received from untrusted sources.\n* [CVE-2016-0797](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0797)\nGuido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BN\\_hex2bn and\n BN\\_dec2bn functions that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and\n heap corruption. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial\n of service or memory corruption in applications processing hex or\n dec data received from untrusted sources.\n* [CVE-2016-0798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0798)\nEmilia KĂ¤sper of the OpenSSL development team discovered a memory\n leak in the SRP database lookup code. To mitigate the memory leak,\n the seed handling in SRP\\_VBASE\\_get\\_by\\_user is now disabled even if\n the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate\n to the SRP\\_VBASE\\_get1\\_by\\_user function.\n* [CVE-2016-0799](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0799),\n[CVE-2016-2842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2842)\nGuido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BIO\\_\\*printf\n functions that could lead to an OOB read when printing very long\n strings. Additionally the internal doapr\\_outch function can attempt\n to write to an arbitrary memory location in the event of a memory\n allocation failure. These issues will only occur on platforms where\n sizeof(size\\_t) > sizeof(int) like many 64 bit systems. This could\n allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or memory\n corruption in applications that pass large amounts of untrusted data\n to the BIO\\_\\*printf functions.\n\n\nAdditionally the EXPORT and LOW ciphers were disabled since thay could\nbe used as part of the DROWN\n([CVE-2016-0800](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0800))\nand SLOTH\n([CVE-2015-7575](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7575))\nattacks, but note that the oldstable (wheezy) and stable (jessie)\ndistributions are not affected by those attacks since the SSLv2 protocol\nhas already been dropped in the openssl package version 1.0.0c-2.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed\nin version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u20.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.0.1k-3+deb8u4.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed shortly.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\n",
