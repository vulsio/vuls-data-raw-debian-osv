This could lead to HTTP requests being sent over the\nconnection authenticated as a different user.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.38.0-4+deb8u3.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.47.0-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\n",
