	"summary": "redis - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that redis, a persistent key-value database, did not\nproperly protect redis-cli history files: they were created by default\nwith world-readable permissions.\n\n\nUsers and systems administrators may want to proactively change\npermissions on existing ~/rediscli\\_history files, instead of waiting\nfor the updated redis-cli to do so the next time it is run.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:2.8.17-1+deb8u5.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this\nproblem has been fixed in version 2:3.2.1-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.\n\n\n",
