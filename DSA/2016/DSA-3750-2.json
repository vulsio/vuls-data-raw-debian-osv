	"details": "\nDawid Golunski discovered that PHPMailer, a popular library to send\nemail from PHP applications, allowed a remote attacker to execute\ncode if they were able to provide a crafted Sender address.\n\n\nNote that for this issue also [CVE-2016-10045](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10045) was assigned, which is a regression in the original patch\nproposed for [CVE-2016-10033](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10033). Because the origial patch was not applied in Debian,\nDebian was not vulnerable to [CVE-2016-10045](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10045).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.2.9+dfsg-2+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 5.2.14+dfsg-2.1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libphp-phpmailer packages.\n\n\n",
