	"details": "\nFelix Doerre and Vladimir Klebanov from the Karlsruhe Institute of\nTechnology discovered a flaw in the mixing functions of Libgcrypt's\nrandom number generator. An attacker who obtains 4640 bits from the RNG\ncan trivially predict the next 160 bits of output.\n\n\nA first analysis on the impact of this bug for GnuPG shows that existing\nRSA keys are not weakened. For DSA and Elgamal keys it is also unlikely\nthat the private key can be predicted from other public information.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.6.3-2+deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libgcrypt20 packages.\n\n\n",
