	"details": "\nSeveral issues were discovered in openvpn, a virtual private network\napplication.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-7479](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7479)\nIt was discovered that openvpn did not properly handle the\n rollover of packet identifiers. This would allow an authenticated\n remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application\n crash.\n* [CVE-2017-7508](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7508)\nGuido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle\n specific malformed IPv6 packets. This would allow a remote\n attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application crash.\n* [CVE-2017-7520](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7520)\nGuido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle\n clients connecting to an HTTP proxy with NTLMv2\n authentication. This would allow a remote attacker to cause a\n denial-of-service via application crash, or potentially leak\n sensitive information like the user's proxy password.\n* [CVE-2017-7521](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7521)\nGuido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle\n some x509 extensions. This would allow a remote attacker to cause\n a denial-of-service via application crash.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2.3.4-5+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.0-6+deb9u1.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2.4.3-1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.3-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openvpn packages.\n\n\n",
