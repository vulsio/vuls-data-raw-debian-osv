	"details": "\nGeorge Shuklin from servers.com discovered that Nova, a cloud\ncomputing fabric controller, did not correctly enforce its image- or\nhosts-filters. This allowed an authenticated user to bypass those\nfilters by simply rebuilding an instance.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 2:14.0.0-4+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your nova packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of nova please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/nova](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/nova)\n\n\n",
