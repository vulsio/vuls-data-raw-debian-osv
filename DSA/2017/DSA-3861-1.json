	"details": "\nJakub Jirasek of Secunia Research discovered that libtasn1, a library\nused to handle Abstract Syntax Notation One structures, did not\nproperly validate its input. This would allow an attacker to cause a\ncrash by denial-of-service, or potentially execute arbitrary code, by\ntricking a user into processing a maliciously crafted assignments\nfile.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.2-3+deb8u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-6 packages.\n\n\n",
