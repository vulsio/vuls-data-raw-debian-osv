	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in kde4libs, the core libraries\nfor all KDE 4 applications. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-6410](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6410)\nItzik Kotler, Yonatan Fridburg and Amit Klein of Safebreach Labs\n reported that URLs are not sanitized before passing them to\n FindProxyForURL, potentially allowing a remote attacker to obtain\n sensitive information via a crafted PAC file.\n* [CVE-2017-8422](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8422)\nSebastian Krahmer from SUSE discovered that the KAuth framework\n contains a logic flaw in which the service invoking dbus is not\n properly checked. This flaw allows spoofing the identity of the\n caller and gaining root privileges from an unprivileged account.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4:4.14.2-5+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4:4.14.26-2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kde4libs packages.\n\n\n",
