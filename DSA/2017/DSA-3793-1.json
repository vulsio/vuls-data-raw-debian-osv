The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2016-6252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6252)\nAn integer overflow vulnerability was discovered, potentially\n allowing a local user to escalate privileges via crafted input to\n the newuidmap utility.\n* [CVE-2017-2616](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2616)\nTobias Stoeckmann discovered that su does not properly handle\n clearing a child PID. A local attacker can take advantage of this\n flaw to send SIGKILL to other processes with root privileges,\n resulting in denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:4.2-3+deb8u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your shadow packages.\n\n\n",
