	"details": "\njoernchen discovered that the git-cvsserver subcommand of Git, a\ndistributed version control system, suffers from a shell command\ninjection vulnerability due to unsafe use of the Perl backtick\noperator. The git-cvsserver subcommand is reachable from the\ngit-shell subcommand even if CVS support has not been configured\n(however, the git-cvs package needs to be installed).\n\n\nIn addition to fixing the actual bug, this update removes the\ncvsserver subcommand from git-shell by default. Refer to the updated\ndocumentation for instructions how to reenable in case this CVS\nfunctionality is still needed.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed\nin version 1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.11.0-3+deb9u2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.14.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your git packages.\n\n\n",
