	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-7518](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7518)\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that KVM is prone to an incorrect debug\n exception (#DB) error occurring while emulating a syscall\n instruction. A process inside a guest can take advantage of this\n flaw for privilege escalation inside a guest.\n* [CVE-2017-7558](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7558)\n (stretch only)\n\n Stefano Brivio of Red Hat discovered that the SCTP subsystem is\n prone to a data leak vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read\n flaw, allowing to leak up to 100 uninitialized bytes to userspace.\n* [CVE-2017-10661](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10661)\n (jessie only)\n\n Dmitry Vyukov of Google reported that the timerfd facility does\n not properly handle certain concurrent operations on a single file\n descriptor. This allows a local attacker to cause a denial of\n service or potentially execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-11600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11600)\nBo Zhang reported that the xfrm subsystem does not properly\n validate one of the parameters to a netlink message. Local users\n with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability can use this to cause a denial\n of service or potentially to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-12134](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12134)\n / #866511 / XSA-229\n\n Jan H. Schoenherr of Amazon discovered that when Linux is running\n in a Xen PV domain on an x86 system, it may incorrectly merge\n block I/O requests. A buggy or malicious guest may trigger this\n bug in dom0 or a PV driver domain, causing a denial of service or\n potentially execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nThis issue can be mitigated by disabling merges on the underlying\n back-end block devices, e.g.:\n `echo 2 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nomerges`\n* [CVE-2017-12146](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12146)\n (stretch only)\n\n Adrian Salido of Google reported a race condition in access to the\n driver\\_override attribute for platform devices in sysfs. If\n unprivileged users are permitted to access this attribute, this\n might allow them to gain privileges.\n* [CVE-2017-12153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12153)\nBo Zhang reported that the cfg80211 (wifi) subsystem does not\n properly validate the parameters to a netlink message. Local users\n with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace with a\n wifi device) can use this to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-12154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12154)\nJim Mattson of Google reported that the KVM implementation for\n Intel x86 processors did not correctly handle certain nested\n hypervisor configurations. A malicious guest (or nested guest in a\n suitable L1 hypervisor) could use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-14106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14106)\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that a user-triggerable division by\n zero in the tcp\\_disconnect() function could result in local denial\n of service.\n* [CVE-2017-14140](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14140)\nOtto Ebeling reported that the move\\_pages() system call performed\n insufficient validation of the UIDs of the calling and target\n processes, resulting in a partial ASLR bypass. This made it easier\n for local users to exploit vulnerabilities in programs installed\n with the set-UID permission bit set.\n* [CVE-2017-14156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14156)\nsohu0106 reported an information leak in the atyfb video driver.\n A local user with access to a framebuffer device handled by this\n driver could use this to obtain sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2017-14340](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14340)\nRichard Wareing discovered that the XFS implementation allows the\n creation of files with the realtime flag on a filesystem with no\n realtime device, which can result in a crash (oops). A local user\n with access to an XFS filesystem that does not have a realtime\n device can use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-14489](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14489)\nChunYu Wang of Red Hat discovered that the iSCSI subsystem does not\n properly validate the length of a netlink message, leading to\n memory corruption. A local user with permission to manage iSCSI\n devices can use this for denial of service or possibly to execute\n arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-14497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14497)\n (stretch only)\n\n Benjamin Poirier of SUSE reported that vnet headers are not\n properly handled within the tpacket\\_rcv() function in the raw\n packet (af\\_packet) feature. A local user with the CAP\\_NET\\_RAW\n capability can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of\n service (buffer overflow, and disk and memory corruption) or have\n other impact.\n* [CVE-2017-1000111](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000111)\nAndrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition in the raw\n packet (af\\_packet) feature. Local users with the CAP\\_NET\\_RAW\n capability can use this for denial of service or possibly to\n execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-1000112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000112)\nAndrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition flaw in the\n UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) code. A local user can use this\n flaw for denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2017-1000251](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000251)\n / #875881\n\n Armis Labs discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem does not\n properly validate L2CAP configuration responses, leading to a\n stack buffer overflow. This is one of several vulnerabilities\n dubbed Blueborne. A nearby attacker can use this to cause a\n denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code on a\n system with Bluetooth enabled.\n* [CVE-2017-1000252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000252)\n (stretch only)\n\n Jan H. Schoenherr of Amazon reported that the KVM implementation\n for Intel x86 processors did not correctly validate interrupt\n injection requests. A local user with permission to use KVM could\n use this for denial of service.\n* [CVE-2017-1000370](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000370)\nThe Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument or\n environment list can result in ASLR bypass for 32-bit PIE binaries.\n* [CVE-2017-1000371](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000371)\nThe Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument\n or environment list can result in a stack/heap clash for 32-bit\n PIE binaries.\n* [CVE-2017-1000380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000380)\nAlexander Potapenko of Google reported a race condition in the ALSA\n (sound) timer driver, leading to an information leak. A local user\n with permission to access sound devices could use this to obtain\n sensitive information.\n\n\nDebian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, but if they\nare enabled (via the kernel.unprivileged\\_userns\\_clone sysctl) then\n[CVE-2017-11600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11600), \n[CVE-2017-14497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14497) and \n[CVE-2017-1000111](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000111) \ncan be exploited by any local user.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.16.43-2+deb8u5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.9.30-2+deb9u5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\n",
