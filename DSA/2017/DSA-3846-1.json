Multiple heap overflows,\nout-of-bound writes and reads, NULL pointer dereferences and infinite\nloops could be exploited by tricking a user into opening a maliciously\ncrafted winmail.dat file.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.5-6+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,\nthese problems have been fixed in version 1.9.2-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libytnef packages.\n\n\n",
