	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer\nlibrary. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-1000100](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000100)\nEven Rouault reported that cURL does not properly handle long file\n names when doing an TFTP upload. A malicious HTTP(S) server can take\n advantage of this flaw by redirecting a client using the cURL\n library to a crafted TFTP URL and trick it to send private memory\n contents to a remote server over UDP.\n* [CVE-2017-1000101](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000101)\nBrian Carpenter and Yongji Ouyang reported that cURL contains a flaw\n in the globbing function that parses the numerical range, leading to\n an out-of-bounds read when parsing a specially crafted URL.\n* [CVE-2017-1000254](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000254)\nMax Dymond reported that cURL contains an out-of-bounds read flaw in\n the FTP PWD response parser. A malicious server can take advantage\n of this flaw to effectively prevent a client using the cURL library\n to work with it, causing a denial of service.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 7.38.0-4+deb8u6.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.52.1-5+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\n",
