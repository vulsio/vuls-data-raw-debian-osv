A remote\n attacker can take advantage of this flaw by carefully crafting a\n sequence of request headers to cause a segmentation fault, or to\n force ap\\_find\\_token() to return an incorrect value.\n* [CVE-2017-7679](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7679)\nChenQin and Hanno Boeck reported that mod\\_mime can read one byte\n past the end of a buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type\n response header.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 2.4.10-10+deb8u9. The oldstable distribution (jessie) is not\naffected by [CVE-2017-7659](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7659).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.25-3+deb9u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.25-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\n",
