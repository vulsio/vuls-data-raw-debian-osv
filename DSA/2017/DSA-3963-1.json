This allowed an attacker to run\n an arbitrary shell command.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 3.1.2-2+deb8u4.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.0-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mercurial packages.\n\n\n",
