	"summary": "bind9 - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that a maliciously crafted query can cause ISC's\nBIND DNS server (named) to crash if both Response Policy Zones (RPZ)\nand DNS64 (a bridge between IPv4 and IPv6 networks) are enabled. It\nis uncommon for both of these options to be used in combination, so\nvery few systems will be affected by this problem in practice.\n\n\nThis update also corrects an additional regression caused by the fix\nfor [CVE-2016-8864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8864),\nwhich was applied in a previous security update.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u10.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this\nproblem has been fixed in version 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\n",
