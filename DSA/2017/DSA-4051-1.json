A malicious server\n could redirect a libcurl-based client to an URL using a wildcard pattern,\n triggering the out-of-bound read.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed\nin version 7.38.0-4+deb8u8.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 7.52.1-5+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of curl please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl)\n\n\n",
