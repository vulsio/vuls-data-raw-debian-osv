	"details": "\nTwo denial of service vulnerabilities were identified in strongSwan, an\nIKE/IPsec suite, using Google's OSS-Fuzz fuzzing project.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-9022](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9022)\nRSA public keys passed to the gmp plugin aren't validated sufficiently\n before attempting signature verification, so that invalid input might\n lead to a floating point exception and crash of the process.\n A certificate with an appropriately prepared public key sent by a peer\n could be used for a denial-of-service attack.\n* [CVE-2017-9023](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9023)\nASN.1 CHOICE types are not correctly handled by the ASN.1 parser when\n parsing X.509 certificates with extensions that use such types. This could\n lead to infinite looping of the thread parsing a specifically crafted\n certificate.\n\n\nA fix for a build failure was additionally included in the 5.2.1-6+deb8u4\nrevision of the strongSwan package.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.2.1-6+deb8u3.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been\nfixed in version 5.5.1-4\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 5.5.1-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.\n\n\n",
