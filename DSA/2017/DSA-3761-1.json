This allowed anyone to login to an existing\nuser account without having to provide a password.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.3.5-1.1+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this\nproblem has been fixed in version 3.6.6-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your rabbitmq-server packages.\n\n\n",
