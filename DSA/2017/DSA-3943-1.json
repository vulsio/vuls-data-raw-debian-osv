With this update XEP-0146 support has been disabled\nby default and made opt-in via the remote\\_commands option.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed\nin version 0.16-1+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed prior\nto the initial release.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your gajim packages.\n\n\n",
