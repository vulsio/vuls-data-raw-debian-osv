	"summary": "libvncserver - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that libvncserver, a collection of libraries used to\nimplement VNC/RFB clients and servers, incorrectly processed incoming\nnetwork packets. This resulted in several heap-based buffer overflows,\nallowing a rogue server to either cause a DoS by crashing the client,\nor potentially execute arbitrary code on the client side.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.9.9+dfsg2-6.1+deb8u2.\n\n\nFor the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these\nproblems have been fixed in version 0.9.11+dfsg-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libvncserver packages.\n\n\n",
