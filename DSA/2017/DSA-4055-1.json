	"details": "\nMichael Eder and Thomas Kittel discovered that Heimdal, an\nimplementation of Kerberos 5 that aims to be compatible with MIT\nKerberos, did not correctly handle ASN.1 data. This would allow an\nunauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (crash of\nthe KDC daemon) by sending maliciously crafted packets.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 7.1.0+dfsg-13+deb9u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of heimdal please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/heimdal](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/heimdal)\n\n\n",
