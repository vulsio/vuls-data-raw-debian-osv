	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server\nimplementation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-3136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3136)\nOleg Gorokhov of Yandex discovered that BIND does not properly\n handle certain queries when using DNS64 with the \"break-dnssec yes;\"\n option, allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service.\n* [CVE-2017-3137](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3137)\nIt was discovered that BIND makes incorrect assumptions about the\n ordering of records in the answer section of a response containing\n CNAME or DNAME resource records, leading to situations where BIND\n exits with an assertion failure. An attacker can take advantage of\n this condition to cause a denial-of-service.\n* [CVE-2017-3138](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3138)\nMike Lalumiere of Dyn, Inc. discovered that BIND can exit with a\n REQUIRE assertion failure if it receives a null command string on\n its control channel. Note that the fix applied in Debian is only\n applied as a hardening measure. Details about the issue can be found\n at <https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01471> .\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u11.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\n\n",
