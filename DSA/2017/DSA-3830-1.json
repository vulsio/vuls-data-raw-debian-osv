An attacker could use\nthis problem to trigger an out-of-bound write through a heap-based\nbuffer overflow, thus causing a denial of service via application\ncrash, or potential execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 52.1-8+deb8u5.\n\n\nFor the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,\nthese problems have been fixed in version 57.1-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your icu packages.\n\n\n",
