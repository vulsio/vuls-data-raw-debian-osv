	"details": "\nRyan Day discovered that the Simple Linux Utility for Resource\nManagement (SLURM), a cluster resource management and job scheduling\nsystem, does not properly handle SPANK environment variables, allowing a\nuser permitted to submit jobs to execute code as root during the Prolog\nor Epilog. All systems using a Prolog or Epilog script are vulnerable,\nregardless of whether SPANK plugins are in use.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 16.05.9-1+deb9u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 17.02.9-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your slurm-llnl packages.\n\n\n",
