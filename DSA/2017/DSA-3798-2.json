Multiple heap overflows, type confusions\nand out of bound reads and writes could be exploited by tricking a\nuser into opening a malicious attachment. This would result in denial\nof service via application crash, or potential arbitrary code\nexecution.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.4.9-1+deb8u1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tnef packages.\n\n\n",
