	"details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Exim, a mail transport\nagent. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing issues:\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-16943](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16943)\nA use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Exim's routines\n responsible for parsing mail headers. A remote attacker can take\n advantage of this flaw to cause Exim to crash, resulting in a denial\n of service, or potentially for remote code execution.\n* [CVE-2017-16944](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16944)\nIt was discovered that Exim does not properly handle BDAT data\n headers allowing a remote attacker to cause Exim to crash, resulting\n in a denial of service.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.89-2+deb9u2. Default installations disable advertising the\nESMTP CHUNKING extension and are not affected by these issues.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of exim4 please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/exim4>\n\n\n",
