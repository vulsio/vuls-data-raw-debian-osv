When the dict passdb and userdb are used\nfor user authentication, the username sent by the IMAP/POP3 client is\nsent through var\\_expand() to perform %variable expansion. Sending\nspecially crafted %variable fields could result in excessive memory\nusage causing the process to crash (and restart).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:2.2.13-12~deb8u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.\n\n\n",
