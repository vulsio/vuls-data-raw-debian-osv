	"summary": "puppet - security update",
	"details": "\nIt was discovered that unrestricted YAML deserialisation of data sent\nfrom agents to the server in the Puppet configuration management system\ncould result in the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n\nNote that this fix breaks backward compability with Puppet agents older\nthan 3.2.2 and there is no safe way to restore it. This affects puppet\nagents running on Debian wheezy; we recommend to update to the\npuppet version shipped in wheezy-backports.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 3.7.2-4+deb8u1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 4.8.2-5.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.\n\n\n",
