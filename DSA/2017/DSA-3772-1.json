	"summary": "libxpm - security update",
	"details": "\nTobias Stoeckmann discovered that the libXpm library contained two\ninteger overflow flaws, leading to a heap out-of-bounds write, while\nparsing XPM extensions in a file. An attacker can provide a specially\ncrafted XPM file that, when processed by an application using the libXpm\nlibrary, would cause a denial-of-service against the application, or\npotentially, the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running the application.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1:3.5.12-0+deb8u1. This update is based on a new upstream\nversion of libxpm including additional bug fixes.\n\n\nFor the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution\n(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:3.5.12-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your libxpm packages.\n\n\n",
